E.g. something like this (commands not tested, there may be typos):</p><p></p><pre><code>    mkfifo sda.fifo\n    echo 'sda.img f 444 root root cat sda.fifo' &gt; <a href=\"http://sda.pf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sda.pf</a>\n    dd if=/dev/sda bs=16777216 &gt; sda.fifo &amp;\n    mkdir empty\n    mksquashfs empty sda.squashfs -pf <a href=\"http://sda.pf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sda.pf</a>\n    mount -o ro,loop sda.squashfs /mnt\n</code></pre>\nYou then have an uncompressed image visible.  If it's a whole-disk image (/dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1), you need to use a program called kpartx to make device nodes for each partition.<p>I recommend reading the man pages and playing around with these utilities in a Virtualbox VM with a small disk.</p><p>Of course, this approach doesn't pay any attention to filesystems.  Which means it works with Windows partitions (unlike LVM or btrfs snapshots).  But there are limitations; it reads and stores \"empty\" space not occupied by files (I recommend making a large file full of zeroes beforehand to make the empty space compress better), restoring to a smaller disk is difficult if not impossible, restoring to a larger disk requires you to resize manually afterwards if you want to use the extra space.</p><p>[1] It's a little easier conceptually to make a squashfs directly from an image file, but that approach requires you to store the image file, which requires temp space equal to the size of the disk you're backing up.   The pseudo-file approach has a benefit of not needing temporary space equal to the size of the disk being backed up, you just need enough space for the compressed result.</p>",

Although comments on papers might be a dangerous area to venture into there are definitely places on the web where the ability to annotate and comment papers is helping science move forward. A good example is the Polymath project and Terry Tao's blog. Tao's recent solution to the Erdos discrepancy problem,an 80-year-old number theory problem, was actually triggered by a comment on his blog. Another example is <a href=\"http://www.fermatslibrary.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.fermatslibrary.com</a>. Although the papers in the platform are more historical/foundational, they were able to get consistently good/constructive comments that help people understand papers better.",

      "text": "&gt; <i>Why is everyone getting so caught up in the free part?</i><p>To restate my final point: there is nuance here, and people are missing it. I'm commenting for the purpose of interrogating the nuance, because I feel somewhat mixed on the issue. For online course material that is offered to enrolled students and required for the completion of a degree, I do not believe anyone is arguing in opposition. However, the collection and publishing of course material provided to enrolled students, then sharing it for free to non-enrolled students is a different matter entirely. The free part is an important detail in this particular matter and its circumstances, and shouldn't be wholly ignored, or treated as if it isn't part of the equation.</p><p>&gt; <i>If the lectures were a dollar would you say that they're obligated to subtitle them then?</i></p><p>Possibly. Most likely, only if paying for the material and following the courses was somehow tied to earning enrolled status and credit toward a degree, though. Because at that point, someone is actually a student looking to obtain something in exchange for studying the material, the university is engaged in the activity for which it receives federal funding, and we would rightly expect the institution to treat them as students according to the law and all its glorious regulations that seek to provide all students with a level playing field. Giving the material to the public at large with no fees or strings attached--meaning no strings attached <i>to either party</i>--isn't something I think we should discourage.</p><p>&gt; <i>Or do you have a specific cost threshold before you expect subtitles?</i></p><p>There is no cost threshold on my mind, no. There is only the threshold of whether the parties consuming the materials are enrolled students seeking a degree at the institution.</p><p>&gt; <i>... but they're also depriving disabled people of them ...</i></p><p>I'm not convinced this is true. The internet is full of freely available information from a variety of sources, much of it in video and audio form, and we do not have a longstanding debate centering on how much of the freely available information in video and audio form is depriving the hearing impaired of that information and should be made accessible. What's happening here is singling out a particularly easy target and asserting that they should be held to a different standard than all the other parties producing free, inaccessible content, and calling it \"depriving disabled people\" of the content. This stirs my something-isn't-quite-right detector, because we are attempting to provide a very narrowly scoped requirement onto a narrowly scoped party, on the basis of taking rules that inarguably apply to their services in one particular set of conditions, and applying them to another, quite different set of conditions.</p><p>&gt; <i>Also, are people forgetting that these are Harvard and MIT? The NAD isn't going to be suing your mom and pop website. Harvard and MIT can afford it and should be held to higher standards.</i></p><p>This is an argument from a pretty low set of standards, honestly. The ability of the party to afford increased accessibility sets up a rather disingenuous cash-gate on the issue, and completely debases the argument for accessibility into an argument about money. We're either concerned about establishing a proper set of guidelines and cultural expectations for making information accessible, regardless of its cost, or we're targeting entities with cash who are otherwise doing something we applaud, and saying because they have the means to do more, they <i>should</i> do more, and bringing the force of the state against them to compel them to do so. This is the kind of thinking that inexorably leads to crafting laws that target specific parties, leave open loopholes for other parties, and wind up subverting our intended goals by allowing those who wish to avoid a particular set of regulations and obligations by reorganizing under an uncovered entity type. We'd surely want to avoid such an outcome--even if it would help us better identify truly bad actors.</p><p>&gt; <i>I hate to use the word due to the anti-SJW frenzy the internet is in these days, but the ableism in this thread is appalling. No one is trying to see from the side of the NAD, with one user even suggesting that it just wants to line its coffers...</i></p><p>I don't think there is an appalling level of ableism in this thread. I am, and I think others are, trying to interrogate the issue from multiple perspectives, but we are coming to different conclusions (or are withholding conclusions) than you seem to expect. Perhaps that's because we're looking at the nuances of the circumstances.</p><p>From the NAD's perspective, I'm questioning and considering the affordances one ought to expect from information being made freely available in its original form, and what limitations can sensibly be agreed to exist--because it is insensible to expect there to be no limitations. This includes interrogating the alleged principles involved, and to what extent and to which parties they apply. When they don't apply equally to all parties, especially when they don't apply equally on the basis of one's ability to pay, I find the alleged principles reveal themselves to be suspect. This perspective, in particular, is the one in which the absence of affordances and obligations on information-releasing parties are felt most acutely. My lacking of a particular ability preventing me from equally enjoying informative and enlightening material is a bitter pill--especially if I can reasonably expect otherwise.</p><p>From the university and academia perspective, I am questioning and considering what reasonable thresholds one ought to be able to easily identify when releasing information in is original form freely to the public, or withholding it because additional accessibility affordances cannot reasonably be provided in light of the return on the time invested versus simply releasing the information. This perspective, in particular, is the one in which the force and burden of the obligations we levy as a society are felt most acutely. For instance, if a professor is teaching a course in which no persons enrolled have a disability, is the professor obligated to only use information which is accessible to serve the unknown contingent of internet consumers should the university decide to release the course materials freely on the internet? Are the lines only drawn at choosing videos with accurate captions? What about all the millions of people with other learning disabilities of some sort--what is the university obligated to do to ensure they are not \"depriving disabled people\" of this information? If other kinds of learning disabilities do not merit such affordances, why not? Why only this one or that one?</p><p>From the social and cultural perspective, I am questioning and considering what expectations and obligations we ought to hold in such cases for both parties, and how we should reasonably define these expectations for accessibility to as many people as possible and the obligations of implementation. Do we base our expectations and obligational determination on defining thresholds of sheer number of people who may potentially be affected by the lack of affordances? Do we only care about certain accessibility affordances, while ignoring others? Why or why not? We have, I think, passed the point of solving many of society's issues with hammers and saws. We now need scalpels. Much as medical science drastically improves outcomes by isolating bad things and eradicating them with precision, instead of simply removing a whole appendage, we need to pay attention to the nuances and rationally interrogate them to figure out what we think is best socially and culturally. If that's increasing the reach of federal disability law to cover information that is given away for free for the masses of internet consumers, okay. But we better establish some bulletproof and sane principles for doing so, and hold all information producers equally accountable. If we don't, then let's drop the veneer that we are holding all individual and organizational entities equally responsible and accountable, and admit we are instead targeting specific entities based on their perceived ability to pay for the increased obligation to be universally accessible.</p><p>Aside from feeling mixed in sum of all the above perspectives and not jumping to immediate and simplistic conclusions that ignore the nuances of circumstance, I continue to feel mixed because I think, as a principle, an accessible web is a better web. I hold firm to the principle that the more information people have access to, the better off they are, and the better a society is for providing this information as accessibly as possible to as many people as possible. However, I think there is also a somewhat disappointing need to include in our rational calculations when information producers, whomever they may be, are publishing that information as they have it, to put it out there, to share it widely with as many people as they can in the form it exists. Perhaps if we had better tools, we could abstract away the burden, then try taking the route of expecting entities to use certain technologies that alleviate the need to take on making things accessible on their own. If we make accessibility a social and cultural good and goal, how might that change how we produce information?</p>",

Something that you'd like to maintain over time? That may scale? Are you working alone on this or not? Is it an exercise to learn a new stack? I started a startup 4 years ago, asked a friend who's a ruby/rails dev for advice about tech/stack, his answer, yes rails is awesome but as you already know python go for Django as my goal was primarily to get stuff done business-wise not so much to learn cool new tech.

In this way it's very hard for me to lose track of anything, despite most of my work communication happening through email.

Here's a few things that help us:<p>- Make a rule that anything that's in master can be deployed by anyone at any time. This will enforce discipline for code review, but also for introducing changes that f.e. require migrations. You'll use feature flags more, split db schema changes into several deployments, make code work with both schema version, etc. All good practices that you'll need anyway when you reach larger scale and run into issues with different versions of code running concurrently during deployments.</p><p>- If you're using Github, check out the recently added options for controlling merging. Enable branch protection for master, so that only pull request that are green on CI and have been reviewed can be merged. Enable different dropdown options for the merge button (eg rebase and merge), these are useful for small changes.</p><p>- It takes some time to get used to those constraints. Make sure that everyone is on board, and do a regular review of the workflow just as you would review your code. It takes some time to get used to, but I think it's worth it in the long run.</p>",

The code is generally messy and horrible, rife with race conditions and barely holding together in parts. (Biggest: 30k LOC.) While I'm proud of my work \u2014 especially design-wise \u2014 I feel most of my time was spent on battling stupid bugs. I haven't gained any specialist knowledge \u2014 just bloggable API experience. There's nothing I could write a book about.</p><p>Meanwhile, when I compulsively dig through one-man frameworks like YapDatabase, Audiobus, or AudioKit, I am left in awe! They're brimming with specialist knowledge. They're incredibly documented and organized. Major features were added over the course of weeks! People have written books <i>about</i> these frameworks, and they were created by my peers \u2014 probably alongside other work. Same with one-man apps like Editorial, Ulysses, or GoodNotes.</p><p>I am utterly baffled by how knowledgeable and productive these programmers are. If I'm dealing with a new topic, it can take weeks to get a lay of the land, figure out codebase interactions, consider all the edge cases, etc. etc. But the commits for these frameworks show that the devs basically worked through their problems over mere days \u2014 to say nothing of getting the overall architecture right from the start. An object cache layer for SQL? Automatic code gen via YAML? MIDI over Wi-Fi? Audio destuttering? Pff, it took me like a month to add copy/paste to my app!</p><p>I'm in need of some recalibration. Am I missing something? Is this quality of work the norm, or are these just exceptional programmers? And even if they are, how can I get closer to where they're standing? I don't want to wallow in my mediocrity, but the mountain looks almost insurmountable from here! No matter the financial cost or effort, I want to make amazing things that sustain me financially; but I can't do that if it takes me ten times as long to make a polished product as another dev. How do I get good enough to consistently do work worth writing books about?</p>",

      "text": "&gt; Looking at the back of the phone, you'd be forgiven for thinking the sensor is just the phone's camera. But that odd-looking dual lens is the scanner, basically the embedded version of the SCiO. It uses spectrometry to shine near-infrared light on objects \u2014 fruit, liquids, medicine, even your body \u2014 to analyze them.<p>&gt; Say you're at at the supermarket and you want to check how fresh the tomatoes are. Instead of squeezing them, you'd just launch the SCiO app, hold the scanner up to the skin of the tomato, and it will tell you how fresh it is on a visual scale. Do the same thing to your body and you can check your body mass index (BMI). You need to specify the thing you're scanning at the outset, and the actually analysis is performed in the cloud, but the whole process is a matter of seconds, not minutes.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy</a></p><p>...

      "text": "In tech circles, it seems that Bayesian statistics is often favored over classical frequentist statistics. In my study of both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, it seems that the results of a Bayesian analysis are generally more intuitive, such as when comparing Bayesian credible intervals to frequentist confidence intervals. It also seems like Bayesian analysis avoids what I think is one of the most serious problems in analysis, the multiple comparisons problem. It's been easy for me to find any number of Bayesian critiques of frequentist stats, but I have rarely seen frequentist defenses against Bayesian stats. This may simply be because I mostly read technology related sites as opposed to more general statistics oriented sites. As such, I would really appreciate hearing some frequentist critiques of Bayesian stats. I feel like the situation can't be as cut and dry as one being better than the other in all things, so I would like to acquire a more balanced perspective by hearing about the other side. Thanks!",

A crucial facet of the problem faced by Bayesian logicism involves how the logic is supposed to apply to scientific contexts where the conclusion sentence is some hypothesis or theory, and the premises are evidence claims. The difficulty is that in any probabilistic logic that satisfies the usual axioms for probabilities, the inductive support for a hypothesis must depend in part on its prior probability. This prior probability represents how plausible the hypothesis is supposed to be based on considerations other than the observational and experimental evidence (e.g., perhaps due to relevant plausibility arguments). A Bayesian logicist must tell us how to assign values to these pre-evidential prior probabilities of hypotheses, for each of the hypotheses or theories under consideration. Furthermore, this kind of Bayesian logicist must determine these prior probability values in a way that relies only on the syntactic logical structure of these hypotheses, perhaps based on some measure of their syntactic simplicities. There are severe technical problems with getting this idea to work. Moreover, various kinds of examples seem to show that such an approach must assign intuitively quite unreasonable prior probabilities to hypotheses in specific cases (see the footnote cited near the end of section 3.2 for details). Furthermore, for this idea to apply to the evidential support of real scientific theories, scientists would have to formalize theories in a way that makes their relevant syntactic structures apparent, and then evaluate theories solely on that syntactic basis (together with their syntactic relationships to evidence statements). Are we to evaluate alternative theories of gravitation (and alternative quantum theories) this way?</p>",

If there are any Excel power users here, could you please describe anything you'd like to be able to do that you can't currently?

What's the YC startup from that cycle that \"is making a new, more powerful spreadsheet\", and what is it doing today? I remember Grid [0], but that was from 2012. Any other companies make innovations that would overturn the spreadsheet paradigm, or at least be copied by Excel/OO/GSheets?</p><p>A commenter mentioned \"Queries\", since many spreadsheet users use spreadsheets like a database. I just recently noticed that GSheets has a QUERY function [1] that uses \"principles of Structured Query Language (SQL) to do searches). The function has been around since 2015 (according to Internet Archive [2]) so perhaps I ignored it because its description then was simply, \"Runs a Google Visualization API Query Language query across data.\"</p><p>It appears that \"Visualization API Query Language\" has a lot of SQL-type features with the immediately obvious exception of joins [3].</p><p>edit: Multiple people said they would like Excel to have online functionality, i.e. like Google Sheets, but being able to accept VBA and any other features of legacy Excel spreadsheets. There's now Excel Online but I haven't used it (still sticking to Office 2011 for Mac if I ever need to use Excel instead of GS).

Then, I thought that during this week I'd teach him HTML and enough CSS to see what's used for. I'm thinking that if he gets excited about typing code and seeing things happening he'll want to study more and learn more advanced stuff in the future and perhaps even make it his profession (this is what my client hopes will happen).</p><p>Now, part of this trip is a 12-hour drive. I thought I could use this time to introduce him to simple programming concepts. For instance, if asked to list all steps involved in starting a car, most people would say:</p><p>- turn key\n- start car</p><p>That could turn into an infinite loop, though. A better way would be:</p><p>- turn key\n- start car\n- if it starts, exit\n- if it doesn't start, repeat 3 more times\n- if it still won't start, call a mechanic</p><p>Stuff like this\u2014that anyone can understand, that can be explained without looking at a computer, but that it's still useful.</p><p>Any idea what I could talk about?

      "text": "I'd love to hear some thoughts about keeping a \"lab notebook\" for ML experiments. I use Jupyter Notebooks when playing around with different ML models, and I find that it really helps to document my thought process with notes and comments. It also seems that the ML workflow is very 'experiment' driven. I'm always thinking \"Hm, I think if I tweak this hyperparameter this way, or adjust this layer this way, then I'll get a better result because X\". Thus, I have a bit of a hypothesis and proposed experiment. I run that model, and see if it improved or not.<p>Then, I run into an issue where I can either: 1. overwrite the original model with my new hyperparameters/design and re-run and analyze or 2. keep adding to the same notebook \"page\" with a new hypothesis/test/analysis loop, thus making the notebook pretty large. With number 1, I often want to backtrack and re-reference how a previous experiment went, but I lose that history. With number 2, it seems to get big pretty quickly, and coming back to the same notebook requires more setup, and \"searching\" the history gets more cumbersome.</p><p>Does anyone try using a separate notebook page for each experiment, maybe with a timestamp or \"version\"? Or is there a better way to do this in a single notebook? I am thinking that something like \"chapters\" could help me here, and it seems like this extension might help me: <a href=\"https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions#table-of-contents\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions#table-of-content...</a></p>",

One constraint is that demand and supply must balance. The grid can\u2019t store much energy. Oversupply can cause grid frequency to go above 50/60 Hz, threatening grid stability: <a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/ebf483/node/705\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.e-education.psu.edu/ebf483/node/705</a>. Power prices go negative when there is too much generation capacity online at a given instant, relative to demand. That creates incentives for generators that can shut down (like natural gas) to do so.</p><p>Negative power prices are not a good thing for consumers. A negative price in the wholesale electric markets does not mean the electricity is \"less than free.\" Obviously, even wind power or solar always costs positive money to generate in real terms. Instead, it signals a mismatch between generation capacity, storage capacity, and demand. In a grid with adequate storage capacity, negative prices would be extremely rare.</p>",

But in practice their bill should stay the same, even if there were significant periods during which energy prices were negative. Why? The negative prices don't indicate that the cost of power production is negative for the power company, so the power company is losing money. The power company has to recoup those losses <i>somehow,</i> and they do it by charging more when power prices are positive.</p><p>In order to take advantage of negative power prices, a power consumer would have to dynamically increase their power consumption in response to the negative prices. If they have any significant power storage capacity, maybe they could store power and sell it back to the grid when prices go positive, or maybe turn on their mining rig while prices are negative, if they go negative frequently.</p>",

Using indicators designed to measure a \u2018safe and just\u2019 development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2\u20136 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.</p><p>&gt; \"Radical changes are needed if all people are to live well within the limits of the planet,\" [...]</p><p>&gt; \"These include moving beyond the pursuit of economic growth in wealthy nations, shifting rapidly from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and significantly reducing inequality.</p><p>&gt; \"Our physical infrastructure and the way we distribute resources are both part of what we call provisioning systems. If all people are to lead a good life within the planet's limits then these provisioning systems need to be fundamentally restructured to allow for basic needs to be met at a much lower level of resource use.\"</p><p>Perhaps ironically, our developments in service of sustainability (resource efficiency) needs for a civilization on Mars are directly relevant to solving these problems on Earth.</p><p>Recycle everything.</p><p>Survive without soil, steel, hydrocarbons, animals, oxygen.</p><p>Convert CO2, sunlight, H20, and geothermal energy to forms necessary for life.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars</a></p><p>Algae, carbon capture, carbon sequestration, lab grown plants, water purification, solar power, [...]</p><p>Mars requires a geomagnetic field in order to sustain an atmosphere in order to [...].</p><p>\"The Limits to Growth\" (1972, 2004) [1] very clearly forecasts these same unsustainable patterns of resource consumption: 'needs' which exceed and transgress our planetary biophysical boundaries.</p><p>The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (#GlobalGoals) [2] outline our worthwhile international objectives (Goals, Targets, and Indicators).

      "text": "Reading Troy Hunt's password release V2 blog post [0], I came across the NIST recommendation to prevent users from creating accounts with passwords discovered in data breaches. This got me thinking: would a website admin (ex. small business owner with a custom website) benefit from a service that validates user passwords? The idea is to create a registration iframe with forms for email, password, etc., which would check hashed credentials against a database of data from breaches. Additionally, client-side validation would enforce rules recommended by the NIST's Digital Identity Guidelines [1], which would relieve admins from implementing their own rules. I'm sure there are additional security features that can be added.<p>1. Have you seen a need for this type of service, and could you see this being adopted at all?</p><p>2. Do you know of a service like this? I've looked, no hits so far.</p><p>3.

(I've contributed to those as well). Some are built on open standards. None of said open platforms have procedures or resources for handling the onslaught of disrespectful trash that the people we've raised eventually use these platforms for communicating at other people who have feelings and understand the Golden Rule.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule</a></p><p>The initial early adopters (who have other better things to do) are fine: helpful, caring, critical, respectful; healthy. And then everyone else comes surging in with hate, disrespect, and vitriol; unhealthy. They don't even realize that being hateful and disrespectful is making them more depressed. They think that complaining and talking smack to people is changing the world. And then they turn off the phone or log out of the computer, and carry on with their lives.</p><p>No-one taught them to be the positive, helpful energy they want to attract from the world. No-one properly conditioned them to either respectfully disagree according to the data or sit down and listen. No-one explained to them that a well-founded argument doesn't fit in 140 or 280 characters, but a link and a headline do. No-one explained to them that what they write on the internet lasts forever and will be found by their future interviewers, investors, jurors, and voters. No-one taught them that being respectful and helpful in service of other people - of the group's success, of peaceful coexistence - is the way to get ahead AND be happy. \"No-one told me that.\"</p><p>Shareholders of public corporations want to see growth in meaningless numbers, foreign authoritarian governments see free expression as a threat to their ever-so-fragile self-perceptions, political groups seek to frame and smear and malign and discredit (because they are so in need of group acceptance; because money still isn't making them happy), and there are children with too much free time reading all of these.</p><p>No-one is holding these people accountable: we need transparency and accountability. We need to focus on more important goals and feel good about helping; about volunteering our time to help others be happier.</p><p>Instead, now that these haters and scam artists have all self-identified, we must spend our time conditioning their communications until they learn to respectfully disagree on facts and data or go somewhere else. \"That's how you feel? Great. How does that make your victim feel?\" is the confrontation that some people are seeking from companies that set out to serve free speech and provide a forum for citizens to share the actual news.</p><p>Who's going to pay for that? Can they sue for their costs and losses? Advertisers do not want a spot next to hateful and disrespectful.</p><p>\"How dare you speak of censorship in such veiled terms!?\" Really? They're talking about taking down phrases like \"kill\" and \"should die\"; not phrases like \"I disagree because:\"</p><p>So, now, because there are so many hateful economically disadvantaged people in the world with nothing better to do and no idea how to run a business or keep a job with benefits, these companies need to staff 24 hour a day censors to take down the hate and terror and gang recruiting <i>within one hour</i>. What a distorted mirror of our divisively fractured wealth inequality, indeed.</p><p>\"Ban gangs ASAP, please: they'll just go away\"</p><p>How much does it cost to pay prison labor to redundantly respond to this trash? Are those the skills they need to choose a different career with benefits and savings that meet or exceed inflation when they get out?</p><p>What is the procedure for referring threats of violence to justice in your jurisdiction? Are there wealthy individuals in your community who would love to contribute resources to this effort? Maybe they have some region-specific pointers for helping the have-nots out here trolling like it's going to get them somewhere they want to be in life?</p><p>Let me share a little story with you:</p><p>A person walks into a bar/restaurant, flicks off the bartender/waiter, orders 5 glasses of free water, starts plastering ads to the walls and other peoples' tables, starts making threats to groups of people cordially conversing, and walks out.</p>",

The examples shown are amazingly, unbelievably good!  Really GREAT WORK.<p>Based on a quick skim of the paper, here is my oversimplified description of how this works:</p><p>During training, an agent navigates an artificial 3D scene, observing multiple 2D snapshots of the scene, each snapshot from a different vantage point.  The agent passes these snapshots to a deep net composed of two main parts: a representation-learning net and a scene-generation net. The representation-learning net takes as input the agent's observations and produces a scene representation (i.e., a lower-dimensional embedding which encodes information about the underlying scene).  The scene-generation network then predicts the scene from three inputs: (1) <i>an arbitrary query viewpoint</i>,  (2) the scene representation, and (3) stochastic latent variables. The two networks are trained jointly, end-to-end, to maximize the likelihood of generating the ground-truth image that would be observed from the query viewpoint.  See Figure 1 on Page 15 of the Open Access version of the paper.  Obviously I'm playing loose with language and leaving out numerous important details, but this is essentially how training works, as I understand it based on a first skim.</p><p>EDIT: I replaced \"somewhat obvious\" with \"natural,\" which better conveys what I actually meant to write the first time around.</p>",

It worked fine except for slight pauses for GC every once in a while which ruined the experience.<p>The best solution I found was to get rid of objects and allocation entirely and instead store the state of the game in  per-type tables like in this article.</p><p>Then I realized that I didn't need per-type tables at all, and if I used what amounted to a union of all types I could store all the game state in a single table, excluding graphical data and textures.</p><p>Next I realized that since most objects had properties like position and velocity, I could update those with a single method by iterating through the table.</p><p>That led to each \"object\" being a collection of various properties acted on by independent methods which were things like gravity and collision detection. I could specify that a particular game entity was subject to gravity or not, etc.</p><p>The resulting performance was fantastic and I found I could have many thousands of on-screen objects at the time with no hiccups. The design also made it really easy to save and replay game state; just save or serialize the single state table and input for each frame.</p><p>The final optimization would have been to write a language that would define game entities in terms of the game components they were subject to and automatically generate the single class that was union of all possible types and would be a \"row\" in the table. I didn't get around to that because it just wasn't necessary for the simple game I made.</p><p>I was inspired to do this from various articles about \"component based game design\" published at the time that were variations on this technique, and the common thread was that a hierarchical OO structure ended up adding a lot of unneeded complexity for games that hindered flexibility as requirements changed or different behaviors for in-game entities were added.</p><p>Edit: This is a good article on the approach. <a href=\"http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy...</a></p>",

This is quite important because wind and solar are not on-demand sources of power.</i><p>I think you have that backwards: in the US, we lack the ability to scale down coal and nuclear plants. Solar and Wind are generally the first to get pulled offline when generated capacity exceeds demand and storage.</p><p>TIL this is called \"curtailment\" and it's an argument that utilities have used to justify not spending on renewables that are saving the environment from global warming (which is going to require more electricity for air conditioning).</p><p>Solar energy production peaks around noon. Demand for electricity  peaks in the evening. We need storage (batteries with supercapacitors out front) in order to store the difference between peak generation and peak use. Because they're unable to store this extra energy, they temporarily shut down solar and wind and leave the polluting plants online.</p><p>Consumers aren't exposed to daily price fluctuations: they get a flat rate that makes it easy to check their bill; so there's no price incentive to e.g. charge an EV at midday when energy is cheapest.</p><p>The 'Duck curve' shows this relation between peak supply and demand in electricity markets:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve</a></p><p>Developing energy storage capabilities (through infrastructure and open access basic research that can be capitalized by all) is likely the best solution. According to a fairly recent report, we could go 100% renewable with the energy storage tech that exists today.</p><p>But there's no money for it. There's money for subsidizing oil production (regardless of harms (!)), but not so much for wind and solar. There's money for responding to natural disasters caused by global warming, but not so much for non-carbon-based energy sources that don't cause global warming. A film called \"The Burden: Fossil Fuel, the Military, and National Security\" quotes the actual unsubsidized price of a gallon of gasoline.</p><p>Wouldn't it be great if there was some kind of computer workload that could be run whenever energy is cheapest ( '<i>energy spot instances</i>') so that we can accelerate our migration to renewable energy sources that are saving the environment for future generations? If there were people who had strong incentives to create demand for power-efficient chips and inexpensive clean energy.</p><p>Where would be if we had continued with Jimmy Carter's solar panels on the roof of the White House (instead of constant war and meddling with competing oil production regions of the world)?</p><p>It's good to see wind and solar growing this fast this year.

We are not landlocked, there is plenty of water in the sea. Desalination is energy intensive. Instead of only looking at energy storage, why can't we increase the processing capacity (more desalination sites capable of working in parallel), and desalinate say sea water during the energy flood? I don't expect this to be an ideal real world example, only a pattern for identifying such examples: any product (could be composite parts, or bulk material) which is relatively compact and has some high energy per product volume processinng step. Just do the process (desalination, welding some part to another part...) when the sun shines, and store them for later.</p><p>Products with very high <i>step energy density</i> are good candidates for storing, and could help flatten daily variations, and perhaps even seasonal variations!</p><p>Now some companies would prefer avoiding risk if they don't have guaranteed orders far enough into the future, then perhaps there should be a market for insurance or loans, so that the company is encouraged to take the risk, instead of wasting the cheap energy...</p>",

At first it's a very strange idea, afterall we work and consume everyday in order to grow the economy. But every healthy system as a homeostastic point, a point where it doesn't need to grow, only to be maintained. \nWe are now a fat society and we need to get our health back, we need to degrow. We need to work much less hours and consume much less. Reducing working hours is a great leverage point. People will start to have time to care about the community, and take care of their own health. Maybe have more time to take a walk instead of using the car. This can improve health and environment but will not contribute to economic growth, healthy people that don't use cars are not good friends of economic growth based on GDP.\nEnglish is not my mother language, Ursula Le Guin had an eloquent post about this on her blog, but was removed to be on the last book. The post is called \"Clinging to a Metaphor\" (the metaphor is economic growth) and the book is called \"No Time to Spare\".\n[1] <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kz9wjJjmkmc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/kz9wjJjmkmc</a>",

We don't choose to elect people that regard the environment (our air, water, land, and other natural resources) as our most important focus. A command economy driven by these folks for longer than a term limit would be even more disastrous.</p><p>The market does not solve for 'externalities': things that aren't costed in. We must have regulation to counteract the blind optimization for profit (and efficiency) which capitalism rewards most.</p><p>Environmental regulation is currently insufficient; worldwide. That is the consensus from the Paris Agreement which 195 countries signed in 2015.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement</a></p><p>Maybe incentives?</p><p>We could sell tokens for how much pollutants we're allowed to f### everyone else over with and penalize exceeding the amount we've purchased. That would incentivize firms to pollute less so that they can save money by having to buy fewer tokens.\n(Europe does this already; and it's still not going to save the planet from industrial production externalities)</p><p>So, while I'm wary of any suggestion that a command economy would somehow bring forth talent in governance,\nI look to this article for actionable suggestions that penalize and/or incentivize sustainable business and living practices.</p><p>Sustainable reporting really is a must: how can I design an investment portfolio that excludes reckless, irresponsible, indifferent, and careless investments and highly values sustainability?</p><p>No one likes to be driven by harsh penalties; everyone likes to be rewarded (even with carrots as incentives).</p><p>Markets do not solve for long term outcomes. Case in point: the market has not chosen the most energy efficient cryptocurrencies. Is this an information asymmetry issue: people just don't know, or just don't care because the incentives are so alluring, the brand is so strong, or <i>the perceived security assurances of the network outweighs the energy use</i> (and environmental impact) in comparison to dry cleaning and fossil fuel transport.</p><p>How would a command economy respond to this? It really is denial and delusion to think that the market will cast aside less energy efficient solutions in order to save the environment all on its own.</p><p>So, what do we do?</p><p>Do we incentivize getting inefficient vehicles off of the road and into a recycling plant where they belong?</p><p>Do we shut down major sources of pollution (coal plants, vehicle emissions)?</p><p>Do we create tokens to account for pollution allowances (for carbon and other toxic f###ing chemicals)?</p><p>Do we cut irrational subsidies for industries that don't pay their taxes (even when they make money); so that we're aware of the actual costs of our behavior?</p><p>Do we grow hemp to absorb carbon, clean up the soil, replace emissions, and store energy?</p><p>Who's in the mood to dom these greedy shortsighted idiots into saving themselves and preventing the violation of our right to health (life)? No, you can't because you're busy violating your own rights and finding drugs/druggies and that's not allowed? Is that a lifetime position?</p><p>\"Go burn a charcoal grill and your gas vehicle in your closed garage for awhile and come talk to me.\" That's really what we're dealing with here.</p><p>Anyways, this paper raises some good points; although I have my doubts about command economies.</p><p>[strikethrough] You can't do that to yourself. [/strikethrough] You can't do that to others (even if you pay for their healthcare afterwards).</p><p>Where's Captain Planet when you need 'em, anyways?</p>",

I think it's misunderstood, and that's my fault: I should have included [sarcasm] around the whole comment [/sarcasm].<p>I've written about our need to address climate change here in past comments. I think the administration's climate change denials (see: \"climate change politifact') and regulatory rollbacks are beyond despicable: they're sabotaging the United States by allowing more toxic chemicals into the environment that we all share, and allowing more sites that must be protected with tax dollars that aren't there because these industries pay far less than <i>benchmarks</i> in terms of effective tax rate. We know that vehicle emissions, mercury, and coal ash are toxic: why would we allow people to violate the rights of others in that way?</p><p>A person could voluntarily consume said toxic byproducts and not have violated their own rights or the rights of others, you understand. There's no medical value and low potential for abuse, so we just sit idly by while they're violating the rights of other people by dumping toxic chemicals into the environment that are both poisonous and strongly linked to climate change.</p><p>What would help us care about this? A sarcastic list of additional reasons that we should care? No! Miami underwater during tourist season is enough! I've had enough!</p><p>So, my mistake here - my downvote-earning mistake - was dropping my generally helpful, hopeful tone for cynicism and sarcasm that wasn't motivating enough.</p><p>We need people to regulate pollution in order to prevent further costs of climate change. Water in the streets holds up commerce, travel, hampers national security, and destroys the road.</p><p>We must stop rewarding pollution if we want it - and definitely resultant climate change - to stop.

Many of the reuse applications to date have used the low-grade server exhaust heat in an application physically adjacent to the data center, such as a greenhouse or swimming pool in the building next door. This is reasonable given the relatively low temperatures of data center return air, usually between 28\u00b0 and 35\u00b0C (80-95\u00b0F), and the difficulty in moving heat around. Moving heat energy frequently requires insulated ducting or plumbing instead of cheap, convenient electrical cables. Trenching and installation to run a hot water pipe from a data center to a heat user may cost as much as $600 per linear foot. Just the piping to share heat with a facility one-quarter mile away might add $750,000 or more to a data center construction project. There\u2019s currently not much that can be done to reduce this cost.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>To address the low-temperature issue, some data center operators have started using heat pumps to increase the temperature of waste heat, making the thermal energy much more valuable, and marketable. Waste heat coming out of heat pumps at temperatures in the range of 55\u00b0 to 70\u00b0C (130-160\u00b0F) can be transferred to a liquid medium for easier transport and can be used in district heating, commercial laundry, industrial process heat, and many more.

He defers his taxes until 2026. Instead of paying capital gains tax on $150/share, the cost basis is adjusted by 15% so in addition to benefiting from the time value of money, future Bob will only be taxed on $142.50 of capital gains. Bob can buy a house in an \"opportunity zone\" (from scrolling around the embedded map, there's plenty of million dollar+ houses in these areas. There's also lots of sports teams and stadiums in these areas, so maybe Bob buys an NFL team or a parking lot next to their stadium), rent it out for 10 years, sell it, and not have to pay any capital gains tax on the appreciation. Definitely not a bad deal for him!</p>",

It does not promote gorund breaking or novel research, it barely (arguably doesn't) even contribute to quality research. I had a colleague recently be told by a journal editor 'we don't publish critiques from junior scholars.' So much for the nature of peer review being entirely driven by the quality of the work.<p>As one of those academics...I keep getting requests to peer review, I respectfully make clear I don't review for non open source journals anymore. Same with publishing. I'm not tenure-track so am not primarily evaluated based on output.</p><p>Publishing is broken, but it is really just part of the broader and even more broken nature of academic research.</p>",

Via the float in his insurance companies, he receives a 0% infinite maturity loan to plow into the market. That financial leverage gives him the ability to beat the market year after year - not his own stockpicking prowess.<p>If you were to start with $1B, then get an extra $2B that you never had to pay back, you too would do quite well holding Coca-Cola and other safe companies with moats. Your returns would be 3x everyone else's.</p><p>Buffett himself has tried to explain the impact of float on Berkshire Hathaway but it never seems to sink in with people.</p>",

Our findings suggest\nthat Buffett\u2019s success is neither luck nor magic\nbut is a reward for a successful implementation of value and quality exposures that have historically produced high returns. Second, we illustrated how Buffett\u2019s record can be viewed as an expression of the practical implementability of academic factor returns after transaction costs and financing costs. We simulated how investors can try to take advan- tage of similar investment principles. Buffett\u2019s success shows that the high returns of these academic factors are not simply \u201cpaper\u201d returns; these returns can be realized in the real world after transaction costs and funding costs, at least by Warren Buffett. Furthermore, Buffett\u2019s exposure to the BAB factor and his unique access to leverage are consistent with the idea that the BAB factor represents reward to the use of leverage.</i></p>",

Wet chemists still like paper notebooks, since it's hard to get a computer close to the bench, and to type while wearing rubber gloves. Academic workers are expected to supply their own computers, and are nervous about getting them damaged or contaminated. Plus, drawing pictures and writing equations on a computer are both awkward.</p><p>Computation related fields lend themselves well to purely electronic notebooks, no surprise.

The stochastic equation governing our model is transformed into a Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the solution of which features \"quantized\" eigenfunctions. Consequently, stock returns follow a mixed \u03c7 distribution, which describes Gaussian and non-Gaussian features. Analyzing the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) All Share Index, we demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional stochastic process models, e.g., the geometric Brownian motion and the Heston model, with smaller fitting errors and better goodness-of-fit statistics. In addition, making use of analogy, we provide an economic rationale of the physics concepts such as the eigenstate, eigenenergy, and angular frequency, which sheds light on the relationship between finance and econophysics literature.</i></p><p>\"Quantum harmonic oscillator\"\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator</a></p>",

You've provided barely any useful information!<p>The quantity of vulnerabilities in an image is not really all that useful information. A large amount of vulnerabilities in a Docker image does not necessarily imply that there's anything insecure going on. Many people don't realize that a vulnerability is usually defined as \"has a CVE security advisory\", and that CVEs get assigned based on a worst-case evaluation of the bug. As a result, having a CVE in your container barely tells you anything about your actual vulnerability position. In fact, most of the time you will find that having a CVE in some random utility doesn't matter. Most CVEs in system packages don't apply to most of your containers' threat models.</p><p>Why not? Because an attacker is very unlikely to be able to use vulnerabilities in these system libraries or utilities. Those utilities are usually not in active use in the first place. Even if they are used, you are not usually in a position to exploit these vulnerabilities as an attacker.</p><p>Just as an example, a hypothetical outdated version of grep in one of these containers can hypothetically contain many CVEs. But if your Docker service doesn't use grep, then you would need to <i>manually run</i> grep to be vulnerable. And an attacker that is able to run grep in your Docker container has <i>already owned you</i> - it doesn't make a difference that your grep is vulnerable! This hypothetical vulnerable version of grep therefore makes no difference in the security of your container, despite containing many CVEs.</p><p>It's the <i>quality</i> of these vulnerabilities that matters. Can an attacker actually exploit the vulnerabilities to do bad things? The answer for almost all of these CVEs is \"no\". But that's not really the product that Snyk sells - Snyk sells a product to show you as many vulnerabilities as possible. Any vulnerability scanner company thinks it can provide most business value (and make the most money) by reporting as many vulnerabilities as it can. For sure it can help you to pinpoint those few vulnerabilities that are exploitable, but that's where your own analysis comes in.</p><p>I'm not saying there's not a lot to improve in terms of container security. There's a <i>whole bunch</i> to improve there. But focusing on quantities like \"amount of CVEs in an image\" is not the solution - it's marketing.</p>",

There is no real package management for Docker. Hell, there isn't even an official way to determine if your image needs an upgrade (I wrote a ruby script that gets the latest tags from a docker repo, extracts the ones with numbers and sorts them in order and compares them to what I have running).<p>Relying on an Alpine/Debian/Ubuntu base helps to get dependencies installed quickly. Docker could have just created their own base distro and some mechanism to track package updates across images, but they did not.</p><p>There are guides for making bare containers, they contain nothing .. no ip, grep, bash .. only the bare minimum libraries and requirements to run your service. They are minimal, but incredibly difficult to debug (sysdig still sucks unless you shell out money for enterprise).</p><p>I feel like containers are alright, but Docker is a partial dumpster fire. cgroup isolation is good, the crazy way we deal with packages in container systems is not so good.</p><p>Sure if you're just checking for base-distro packages for security vulnerabilities, you're going to find security issues that don't apply (e.g. an exploit in libpng even though your container runs nothing that even links to libpng), but it does excuse the whole issue with the way containers are constructed.</p><p>I think this space is really open too, for people to find better systems that are also portable: image formats that are easy to build, easy to maintain dependencies for, and easy to run as FreeBSD jails OR Linux cgroup managed containers (Docker for FreeBSD translated images to jails, but it's been unmaintained for years).</p>",

You define the state you want your infrastructure to and Kubernetes takes care of maintaining that state. Tools like Ansible and Puppet, as great as they are, do not guarantee your infrastructure will end up in the state you defined and you easily end up with broken services. The only complexity in kubernetes is the fact that it <i>forces</i> you to <i>think</i> and carefully <i>design</i> your infra in a way people aren't used to, yet. More upfront, careful thinking isn't complexity. It can only benefit you in the long run.<p>There is, however, a learning curve to Kubernetes, but it isn't this sharp. It does require you to sit down and read the doc for 8 hours, but that a small price to pay.</p><p>A few month back I wrote a blog post[1] that, through walking through the few different infrastructures my company experimented with over the years, surfaces many reasons one would want to use [a managed] Kubernetes.

      "text": "One major advantage of the gitflow/hubflow git workflows is that there is a standard way of merging across branches. For example, a 'hotfix' branch is merged into the stable master branch  and also develop with one standard command; there's no need to re-explain and train new devs on how the branches were supposed to work here. I even copied the diagram(s) into my notes: <a href=\"https://westurner.github.io/tools/#hubflow\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://westurner.github.io/tools/#hubflow</a><p>IMHO, `git log` on the stable master branch containing each and every tagged release is preferable to having multiple open release branches.</p><p>Requiring tests to pass before a PR gets merged is a good policy that's independent of the trunk or gitflow workflow decision.</p>",

Both in private and work situations.</p><p>I get it now. Checklists reduce cognitive load tremendously well, even for basic tasks. As an example: I have a checklist for when I need to travel, it contains stuff like what to pack, asking someone to feed my cat, check windows are closed, dishwasher empty, heating turned down, etc. Before the checklist, I would always be worried I forgot something, now I can relax.</p><p>Also, checklists are a great way to improve processes. Basically a way to debug your life. For instance: I once forgot to empty the trash bin before a long trip, I added that to my checklist and haven't had a smelly surprise ever since ;)</p>",

He was about to pass out and he asked me not call an ambulance (God bless America) , he appeared to have a concussion. \nBy this time there was about 10-15 people around him and he could barely talk. I asked him what his phone code was and instead of just giving it to me he said \"it's the first four prime numbers\". \nImmediately, about five people shout \"1,2,3,5\". I am no longer holding the phone, because I handed to someone else to make sure it was okay. \nSure enough, I was in a mathematical proofs class and we had just discussed this topic. So, I say \"one is not a prime number\".\nOf course, we get the phone unlocked in the second try with \"2,3,5,7\" and the guys mom is on the way. Everyone thought I was a genius a hero.",

      "text": "The difference big data/data science/empirical study and 'classical' economics (by which I'd include any system of economics that seeks to explain human behavior via an underlying metatheory) is that a primarily empirical approach obscures the necessary underlying theory present in any experiment where you're trying to fit data to a curve.<p>For example, when you run a science experiment and you plot the data, you may find that you're looking at a line. While this is an interesting finding, it has zero predictive value for anything other than the exact situation you've collected data for. In order to formulate scientific law, you first must (a) believe that such a thing exists and (b) have some theory as to what shape the curve ought to fit. For example, a naive look at physics using an 'empirical' approach might incorrectly conclude that force is mass times acceleration. While moderately useful for many problems, this offers little predictive power in the general case. In order to actually formulate a law that can be of predictive value, you have to first consider various other laws and axioms (such as the constant speed of light for force), at which point -- by deduction, without any need of empirism -- you determine that this is wrong, and you need another kind of equation to fit your data to.</p><p>I don't know if the simplistic demand curves drawn in the original text book are correct or not. However, at least those are based on a particular set of assumptions that can be validated or not. The kind of empiricism put forth by Mr Chetty does not offer this at all.</p><p>All this is to say that, while data is useful for validation, it is not useful for prediction. The last thing we need is a black-box machine learning model to make major economic decisions off of. What we do need is proper models that are then validated, which don't necessarily need 'big data.'</p>",

Maybe they're not good at it, maybe the very problem is unsolvable, but it's not because they don't know how Random Forests or RNNs work. Economists already <i>know</i> that students from single parent families do worse at school than from married families. If the problem is just to predict individual student results, number of parents in the household is certainly a good predictor. The problem facing economists is, would encouraging marriage or discouraging diveroce improve student results? Nothing in PyTorch or Tensorflow will help with the answer..</p>",

      "text": "Using predictive models for policy is not new, in fact it was the standard approach long before more inferential models, and the famed Lucas critique precisely targets a primitive approach similar to what you are proposing.<p>The issue is the following: In economics, one is interested in an underlying parameter of a complex equilibrium system (or, if you wish, a non-equilibrium complex system of multi-agentic behavior).\nThis may be, for example, some pricing parameter for a given firm - say - how your sold units react to setting a price.</p><p>Economics faces two basic issues:</p><p>First, any predictive model (like a NN or simple regression) that takes price as an input, will not correctly estimate the sensitivity of revenue to price. It is actually usually the case, that the inference is reversed.</p><p>A model where price is input, and sold units or revenue is output (or vice-versa) will predict (you can check that using pretty much any dataset of prices and outputs) that higher prices lead to higher outputs, because that is the association in the data. \nOf course we know that in truth, prices and outputs are co-determined. They are simultaneous phenomena, and regressing one on the other is not sufficient to \"causally identify\" the correct effect.</p><p>This is independent of how sophisticated your model is otherwise. Fitting a better non-linear representation does not help.</p><p>The solution is of course to reduce down these \"endogenous\" phenomena to their basic ingredients. Say you have cost data, and some demand parameters. Then, using a regression model (or NN) to predict the vector of endogenous outcome variables will work, and roughly give you the right inference.</p><p>Then, as a firm, you are able to use these (more) exogenous predictive variables to find your correct pricing.</p><p>This is not new, pops up everywhere in social science, is the basis of a gigantic literature called econometrics, and really has nothing to do with how you do the prediction.</p><p>The only thing that NN add are better predictions (better fitting) and the ability to deal with more data. As this inferential problem shows, using more (and more fine-grained) data is indeed crucial to predicting what a firm should do.</p><p>BUT, it is crucial to understand and reason about the underlying causality FIRST, because otherwise even the most sophisticated statistical approach will simply give you wrong results.</p><p>Secondly, the counterfactual data for economic issues is usually very scarce. The approach taken by machine learning is problematic, not only because of potentially wrong inference, but also because two points in time may simply not be based on comparable data-generating processes.</p><p>In fact, this is exactly the blindness that led to people missing the financial crisis. Of course, with enough data, and long enough samples, one should expect to be become pretty good at predicting economic outcomes. But experience has shown that in economics, these data are simply too scarce. The unobserved variation between two quarters, two years, two countries, two firms (etc.) is simply very large and has fat tails. This leads to spontaneous breakdowns of such predicitive models.</p><p>Taking these two issues together, we see that better non-linear function approximation is not the solution to our problems. Instead, it is a methodological improvement that must be used in conjunction with what we have learned about causality.</p><p>Indeed the literature moves into a different direction. Good economic science nowadays means to identify effects via natural experiments and other exogenous shifts that can plausibly show causality.</p><p>Of course such experiments are more rare, and more difficult, the larger the scale becomes. Which is why Macroeconomics is arguably the \"worst science\" in economics, while things like auctions and microstructure of markets are actually surprisingly good science (nowadays).</p><p>Doors are wide open for ML techniques, but really only to the point that they are useful in operationalizing more and better data.</p><p>Anyone trying to understand economic phenomena needs to be keenly aware of how inference can be done, which requires an understanding (or an approach to) - that is, a theory - of the underlying mechanisms.</p>",

Where these come from is besides the point. You will always employ a theory, implicitly or explicitly.</p><p>The major issue is not the we use theories, but rather that we might do it implicitly, hiding the assumptions about the DGP that allows causal inference. This is where humans are bad. Theories are just theories.

The issue of causal inference is a \"hot topic\" in many fields, including AI, but the underlying philosophical issues are not exactly new. This includes information theory.</p><p>You seem to think that ML has somehow solved this problem. From my reading of these books, I certainly disagree. Causal inference is certainly POSSIBLE - just as in statistics, but ML doesn't give it to you for free!</p><p>In particular, note the following issue: To show causal identification, you need to make assumptions on your DGP (exogenous variation, timing, graphical causal relations ... whatever). Even if these assumptions are very implicit, they do exist.\nJust by looking at data, and running a model, you do not get causal inference. It can not be done \"within\" the system/model.</p><p>If you bake these things into your AI, then it, too makes these assumptions. There really is no difference. For example, I could imagine an AI that can identify likely exogenous variations in the data and use them to predict counterfactuals. That's probably not too far off, if it doesn't exist already. But, this is still based on the assumption that these variations are, indeed exogenous, which can never be proven within the DGP.</p><p>In contrast, I find that most \"AI scientists\" care very much about prediction, and very little about causal inference. I don't mean this subfield doesn't exist. But it is a subfield. In contrast, for many non-AI scientists, causal inference IS the fundamental question, and prediction is only an afterthought. ML in practice involved doing correct experiments (AB testing), at best. It will sooner or later also adopt all other causal inference techniques. But, my point stands, I have yet to see what ML adds.\nEnlighten me!</p><p>AI, ML and stats will merge, if they haven't already. The distinction will disappear. I believe the issues will not. I employ a lot of AI/ML techniques in my scientific work. Never have they solved the underlying issue of causal inference for me!</p>",

      "text": "I am at loss at what you want to say to me, but let me reiterate:<p>Any learning model by itself is a statistical model. Statistical models are never automatically causal models, albeit causal models are statistical models.</p><p>Several causal models can be observationally equivalent to a single statistical model, but the substantive (inferential) implications on doing \"an intervention\" on the DGP differ.</p><p>It is therefore not enough to validate and run on a model on data. Several causal models WILL validate on the same data, but their implications are drastically different. The data ALONE provides you no way to differentiate (we say, identify) the correct causal model without any further restrictions.</p><p>By extension, it is impossible for any ML mechanism to predict unobserved interventions without being a causal model.</p><p>ML and AI models CAN be causal models, which is the case if they are based on further assumptions about the DGP. For example, they may be graphical models, SCM/SEM etc. These restrictions can be derived algorithmically, based on all sorts of data, tuning, coding and whatever. It really doesn't change the distinction between causal and statistical analysis.</p><p>The way these models become causal is based on assumptions that constitute a theory in the scientific sense. These theories can then of course also be validated. But this is not based on learning from historical data alone. You always have to impose sufficient restrictions on your model (e.g. the DGP) to make such causal inference.</p><p>This is not new, but for your benefit, I basically transferred the above from an AI/ML book on causal analysis.</p><p>AI/ML can do causal analysis, because its statistics. AI/ML are not separate from these issues, do not solve these issues ex-ante, are not \"better\" than other techniques except on the dimensions that they are better as statistical techniques, AND, most importantly, causal application necessarily implies a theory.</p><p>Whether this is implicit or explicit is up to the researcher, but there are dangers associated with implicit causal reasoning.</p><p>And as Pearl wrote (who is not a fan of econometrics by any means!), the issue of causal inference was FIRST raised by econometricians BASED on combining the structure of economic models with statistical inference. In the 1940's.</p><p>I mean I get the appeal to trash talk social sciences, but when it comes to causal inference, you probably picked exactly the wrong one.</p><p>You are free to disregard economic theory. But you can not claim to do causal analysis without any theory. Doing so implicitly is dangerous.\nFurthermore, you are wrong in the sense that economic theory has put causal inference issues at the forefront of econometric research, and is therefore good for science even if you dislike those theories.</p>",

What you did to make it a causal inference is implicitly assume a theory about how markets work (e.g. - as they do right now -) and that it will stay this way.\nActually, you did a lot more, but that's enough.</p><p>Now, you and me, we can both agree that your model with yield curves is good enough. We could even agree that you would have found it before the financial crashes, and are a billionaire.\nBut the commonality we agree upon is a context that defines a theory.</p><p>Some alien that has been analyzing financial systems all across the universe may disagree, saying that your statistical model is in fact highly sensitive to Earth's political, societal and natural context.</p><p>Such is the difficulty of causal analysis.</p>",

(With their NN)<p>It's up for debate if NN's represent what is going on in our heads. But let's for a moment assume it is so.</p><p>Then indeed, an economist leverages a big set of data and assumptions about causal connections to speculate how this intervention would change the DGP (the modules in the causal model) and therefore how the result would change.</p><p>An AI could potentially do the same (if that is really what we humans do), but so far, we certainly lack the ability to program such a general AI. The reason is, in part, because we have difficulty creating causal AI models even for specialized problems. In that sense, humans are much more sophisticated right now.</p><p>It is important to note that such a hypothetical AI would create a theory, based on all sorts of data, analogies, prior research and so forth, just like economists do.</p><p>It does not really matter if a scientist, or an AI, does the theorizing. The distinction is between causal and non-causal analysis.</p><p>The value of formal theory is to lay down assumptions and tautological statements that leave no doubt about what the theory is. \nIf we see that the theory is wrong, because we disagree on the assumptions, this is actually very good and speaks for the theory. Lot's of social sciences is plagued by \"general theories\" that can never really shown to be false ex ante. And given that theories can never be empirically \"proven\", only validated in the statistical sense, this leads to a many parallel theories of doubtful value.\nTake a gander into sociology if you want to see this in action.</p><p>Secondly, and this is very important, is that we learn from models. This is not often recognized. What we learn from writing down models is how mechanics or modules interact. These interactions, highly logical, are USUALLY much less doubtful than the prior assumptions.\nFor example, if price and revenues are equilibrium phenomena, we LEARN from the model that we CAN NOT estimate them with a standard regression model!</p><p>This is exactly what lead to causal analysis in this case, because earlier we would literally regress price on quantity or production on price etc. and be happy about it. But the results were often even in the entirely wrong direction!</p><p>Instead, looking at the theory, we understood the mechanical intricacies of the process we supposedly modeled, and saw that we estimated something completely different than what we interpreted. \nCausal analysis, among other things, tackles this issue by asking \"what it is really that we estimate here?\".</p>",

Financial data has an extremely low signal to noise ratio and it is fraught with pitfalls. It is highly non-normal, heteroscedastic, non-stationary and frequently changes behavioural regimes. It is irregular, the information content is itself irregular and the prices sold by vendors often have difficult to detect issues that will taint your results until you actually start trading and realise that a fundamental assumption was wrong. You may train a model on one period, and find that the market behaviour has changed and your model is rubbish. Cross validation and backtesting on black box algorithms with heavy parameter tuning is a field of study on it\u2019s own with so many issues that endless papers have been written on each specific nuance.</p><p>Successfully building ML models for trading is an extremely difficult discipline that requires a deep understanding of the markets, the idiosyncrasies of market data, statistics and programming. Most quant shops who run successful ML Algos (they are quite rare) have dedicated data teams whose entire remit is to source and clean data. The saying of rubbish in, rubbish out is very true. Even data providers like Reuter\u2019s or Bloomberg frequently have crap data. We pay nearly 500k a year to Reuters, and find errors in their tick data every week. Data like spot forex is a special beast because the market is decentralized. There is no exchange which could provide an authoritative price feed. Trades have been rolled back in the past and if your data feed does not reflect this, you are effectively analysing junk data.</p><p>I don\u2019t even want to get started about the fact that trying to train an RNN on 5500 observations is folly. Did you treat the data in any way? The common way to regularise market data for ML is to resample it to information bars. This is not going to work on a daily basis, so you should start off with actual tick data.</p><p>Nearly every starry eyed junior quant goes in with the notion that you can just run some fancy ML models on some market data and you\u2019ll get a star trading algo. That a small handful of statistical tests will tell you whether your results are meaningful, whether your data has autocorrelation or mean reverting properties. In reality, ML models are very difficult to train on financial data. Most statistical forecasting tools fail to find relationships and blindly training models on past data very rarely results in more than spurious performance in a back test.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to discourage you by any means, but I\u2019d start off with something easier than what you are proposing. Finance firms have entire teams dedicated to what you are trying to do and even they often fail to find anything.</p>",

It's not even clear whether or not \"wealth\" refers to a flow or stock -- Adam Smith uses the term both ways.  And much contemporary mainstream 'wealth creation\" discussion addresses <i>accounting profit</i> rather than <i>economic wealth</i>.  Or broader terms such aas <i>ecological wealth</i> (or natural capital).  There's some progress, and Steve Keen has been synthesizing much of it recently, but the terms fare poorly.</p><p>A key issue is that \"price\u2018 and \"exchange value\" are ofteen conflated, creating confusiin with use/ownership value.</p><p>Addressing your terms, \"cost\" and \"price\", and typically \"value\", indicate some metric of <i>exchange</i> or <i>opportunity cost</i> (or benefit).  Whilst \"wealth\", as typically used, tends to relate to some <i>store</i> or <i>accumulation</i>.  In electrical terms (a potentially, so to speak, useful analogue) the difference between voltage and charge, with current representing some other property, possibly material flows of goods or energy.</p><p>The whole question of <i>media for exchange</i> (currency, and the like), and <i>durable forms of financial wealth</i> (land, art, collectibles) is another interesting one, with discussionnby Ricardo and Jevons quite interesting -- both useful and flawed.</p><p>And don't even get me started on the near total discounting of accumulated natural capital, say, the 100-300 million year factor of time embodied in fossil fuels.

Gvim with my dotvim works great there too though. Someday I'll merge my dotvim with SpaceVim and give SpaceMacs a try; `git clone; make install` works great, but vim-enhanced/vim-full needs to be installed with the system package manager first so that the vimscript plugin installer works and so that the vim binary gets updated when I update all.</p><p>I've tested plenty of Ansible server configs with molecule (in docker containers), but haven't yet taken the time to do a full workstation build with e.g. KVM or VirtualBox or write tests with testinfra. It should be easy enough to just run Ansible as a provisioner in a Vagrantfile or a Packer JSON config. VirtualBox supports multi-monitor VMs and makes USB passthrough easy, but lately Docker is enough for everything but Windows (with a PowerShell script that installs NuGet packages with chocolatey) and MacOS (with a few setup scripts that download and install .dmg's and brew) VMs. Someday I'll write or adapt Ansible roles for Windows and Mac, too.</p><p>I still configure browser profiles by hand; but it's pretty easy because I just saved all the links in my tools doc: <a href=\"https://westurner.github.io/tools/#browser-extensions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://westurner.github.io/tools/#browser-extensions</a></p><p>Someday, I'll do bookmarks sync correctly with e.g. Chromium and Firefox; which'll require extending westurner/pbm to support Firefox SQLite or a rewrite in JS with the WebExtension bookmarks API.</p><p>A few times, I've decided to write docs for my dotfiles and configuration management policies like someone else is actually going to use them; it seemed like a good exercise at the time, but invariably I have to figure out what the ultimate command sequence was and put <i>that</i> in a shell script (or a Makefile, which adds a dependency on GNU make that's often worth it)</p><p>Clonezilla is great and free, but things get out of date fast in a golden master image. It's actually possible to PXE boot clonezilla with Cobbler, but, AFAICT, there's no good way to secure e.g. per-machine disk or other config with PXE. Apt-cacher-ng can proxy-cache-mirror yum repos, too. Pulp requires a bit of RAM but looks like a solid package caching system. I haven't yet tested how well Squid works as a package cache when all of the machines are simultaneously downloading the exact same packages before a canary system (e.g. in a VM) has populated the package cache.</p><p>I'm still learning to do as much as possible with Docker containers and Dockerfiles or REES (Reproducible Execution Environment Specifications) -compatible dependency configs that work with e.g. repo2docker and <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://mybinder.org/</a> (BinderHub)</p>",

      "text": "&gt; The stratifications on this are troubling.<p>They are, yet almost no one I know of (in leadership positions, or the general public) seems to think they're troubling enough to put any serious effort into determining with some level of certainty <i>why</i> there is so much stratification along political lines on so many important issues, this being only one of them.  \"Conservatives are uneducated\" sounds about right so that's what we'll go with it seems, regardless of whether it's actually correct.  That belief <i>may</i> be right, <i>but it may not</i>.</p><p>&gt; It's not a partisan issue: we all pay these costs.</p><p>In <i>one</i> perspective, but as is usually the case, there are several perspectives involved.  Another non-trivial perspective is that the solution <i>requires</i> non-partisan cooperation, and from that perspective partisanship is not only an issue, it is a crucially important issue, so we might be well served by putting some effort into understanding the true nature of it.</p><p>&gt; Weather disasters are getting more severe. It is objectively, quantitatively true that weather disasters are getting more frequent and more severe.</p><p>For certain definitions of \"more\", \"severe\", \"objectively\", \"true\", and \"frequent\".</p><p>So if the problem isn't simply that \"conservatives are uneducated\", what else might it be?  I think the answer lies in the incredibly complex manner in which people perceive the world in general, what information they consume, how they perceive that information, and how they integrate it into their personal internal overall worldview.  People <i>think</i> they think in facts, but they actually think in stories, and in turn this affects how they consume new information.</p><p>Take this simple article as an example, and notice the variety of perspectives we see already with just a few (14 at the time of my writing) comments posted in this thread.  Notice how people aren't discussing just the content of the article, but rather including related ideas from past information they have consumed and stored (the mechanics of which we do not understand) within the mental model of the world they hold in their brain.  An even better example of this behavior can be seen in the recent discussion on the CDC report on vaping: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20915520\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20915520</a>  Observe all the complex perspectives based on the very same \"facts\" in the article.  Observe all the assertions of related \"facts\", that are actually only opinions.  Observe all the mind reading.</p><p>If you start looking for this phenomenon you will notice it everywhere, and if you pay closer attention you may also notice that certain topics are particularly prone to devolving into narrative (rather than fact) based conversation.  The usual suspects are obvious: religion, gender, sexuality, etc, but smoking/vaping seems to me like somewhat of an interesting outlier.  The former examples are very closely tied to personal identity, but while smoking/vaping shares an identity attribute to some degree, I feel like there's some other unseen psychological issue in play that results in such high polarization of beliefs.</p><p>My guess is you and I see very different things despite consuming the very same article.  I lean conservative/libertarian (generally speaking), and I am <i>deeply</i> distrustful of government (for extremely good reasons I believe), so I know for a fact that my interpretation of the article is going to be heavily distorted by that.  Any logical inconsistency, ambiguousness, disingenuousness, technical dishonesty, or anything else along those lines is going to get red flagged in my mind, whereas others will read it in a much more forgiving fashion.  And in an article on a different political hot topic, we will switch our behaviors.</p><p>In such threads, I think it would be <i>extremely</i> interesting for people with opposing views to post excerpts of the parts that \"catch your attention\", with an explanation of why.  This is kind of what happens anyway, but I'm thinking with a completely different motive:  rather than quoting excerpts with commentary to argue your ~political side of the issue with the goal of \"winning the argument\", take an unemotional, more abstract view of your <i>personal cognitive processing</i> of the article, and post commentary on ~why/how you believe you feel you consider that important on a psychological level.  Psychological self-analysis is famously difficult, but even with moderate success I suspect some very interesting things would rise to the surface.</p>",

HN avoids (dang aggressively shuts down, to the detriment of the world imho, because if smart people can't find a way to discuss these things objectively, how do we expect the average person on the street to) political discussions that have a caustic odor, but there's <i>plenty</i> of political shit talking on HN.</p><p>&gt; \"conservative/libertarian\" do you mean: fiscally conservative</p><p>Yes, but the real kind, not the phonies we've had for decades.</p><p>&gt; socially libertarian (Liberty as a fundamental right; if you're not violating the rights of others the government is not obligated or even granted the right to intervene at all)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; or conservative as in imposing your particular traditional standard of moral values which you believe are particular to a particular side of the aisle</p><p>To a degree, but here I think you're dealing with an interpretation of reality more than reality itself (not meant as an insult; it's how humans are).  But yes, somewhat, and this is a whole other interesting and important conversation, that I think society should be having in a more serious / less polarized way.</p><p>&gt; Or, do you mean that you're libertarian in regards to the need and the right to regulate business and industry in the interest of consumers (\"laissez faire\")?</p><p>I used to be very laissez faire, but in many specific areas I am now the exact opposite - if I was in charge, corporations would be in for a very rude awakening.  But laissez faire is my default stance until facts suggest it is excessively harmful to the greater good.</p><p>&gt; At issue here, I think, is whether we think we can avert future escalations of costs by banding together to address climate change now</p><p>100% agree.  But if we willfully ignore the realities of human nature/psychology, I predict we'll never be able to even remotely band together, especially in the hyper-weaponized-meme world we now find ourselves in.  Averting future escalations is the larger goal, but it is completely dependent upon cooperation, which is dependent on communication &amp; <i>perception</i>.  I believe perception is where we are failing most.</p><p>&gt; I'm personally and financially far more concerned about the long-term costs of climate change than a limited number of special interests who can very easily diversify and/or divest to take advantage of the exact same opportunities.</p><p>Me too.</p><p>&gt;&gt; and I am deeply distrustful of government (for extremely good reasons I believe), so I know for a fact that my interpretation of the article is going to be heavily distorted by that. Any logical inconsistency, ambiguousness, disingenuousness, technical dishonesty, or anything else along those lines is going to get red flagged in my mind, whereas others will read it in a much more forgiving fashion. And in an article on a different political hot topic, we will switch our behaviors.</p><p>&gt; While governments (and militaries (TODO)) do contribute substantially to emissions and resultant climate change, I think it unnecessary to qualify that unregulated decisions by industry should be the primary focus here. Industry has done far more to cause climate change than governments (which can more efficiently provide certain services useful to all citizens)</p><p>I think you misunderstood.  Here I'm not talking about government/military damage to the environment (although that's a very big deal, <i>the hypocrisy of which reinforces my distrust even more</i>), I'm saying that I don't trust what they're up to <i>at all</i>.  With a few exceptions (Bernie Sanders, etc), I am very distrustful of the true honesty and sincerity of all politicians regardless of affiliation.  I suppose this is less that they're fundamentally dishonest, but rather the nature of our system is such that you have to be dishonest.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In such threads, I think it would be extremely interesting for people with opposing views to post excerpts of the parts that \"catch your attention\", with an explanation of why. This is kind of what happens anyway, but I'm thinking with a completely different motive: rather than quoting excerpts with commentary to argue your ~political side of the issue with the goal of \"winning the argument\", take an unemotional, more abstract view of your personal cognitive processing of the article,</p><p>&gt; These people aren't doing jack about the problem because they haven't reviewed this chart: \"Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Time Series\" (1980-2019) <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series</a>  Maybe they want insurance payouts, which result in higher premiums. Maybe the people who built in those locations should be paying the costs.</p><p>I'm afraid you've completely misunderstood.  I was referring to a meta discussion, on human psychology and the nature of perception - the distinctly different way in which you and I <i>consume, perceive, store, integrate, and recall</i> the information in an article, not the information itself.  I believe this is where the solution to these problems is hiding.</p><p>&gt; They don't even care because they refuse to accept that it's a problem.</p><p>Here you are acting as if you are able to read the minds of other people.  Intuition, which is kind of a dimensional compression of perceived reality, has evolved in humans because it is extremely useful.  However, when dealing with high complexity, it can be dangerous.</p><p>&gt; ( I had hoped that the other top-level post I posted here would develop into a discussion, but these excerpts seem to have bubbled up. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20919368\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20919368</a> )</p><p>Oh, you're not wrong on those facts I'm sure, but people don't think in facts.  They <i>think</i> they do, but they don't actually.  If we want to do something about these and other problems, you have to look for the invisible blockages, and some of them are within you and I, despite the sincerity of our intentions.</p><p>Unfortunately, even genuinely smart people (like much of the HN crowd) seem to be extremely resistant to even considering this notion.  I suspect the problem is that although a person may be highly educated, at the subconscious level they are still highly tribal.  But I believe if we can get people to start to realize these things, to see the world in this abstract form, then much of the rest might fall into place far easier than the current <i>apparent</i> polarization of beliefs would suggest.</p>",

      "text": "Graph query languages are nice and all, but what about Linked Data here?\nQueries of schemaless graphs miss lots of data because without a schema\nthis graph calls it \"color\" and that graph calls it \"colour\"\nand that graph calls it \"\u8272\" or \"\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\". (Of course this is also an issue even when there is a defined schema; but it's hardly possible to just happen to have comprehensible inter or even intra-organizational cohesion without e.g. RDFS and/or OWL and/or SHACL for describing (and changing) the shape of the data)<p>So, the task is then to compile schema-aware SPARQL to GQL or GraphQL or SQL or interminable recursive SQL queries or whatever it is.</p><p>For GraphQL, there's GraphQL-LD (which somewhat unfortunately contains a hashtag-indeterminate dash). I cite this in full here because it's very relevant to the GQL task at hand:</p><p>\"GraphQL-LD: Linked Data Querying with GraphQL\" (2018) <a href=\"https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Demo-GraphQlLD/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://comunica.github.io/Article-ISWC2018-Demo-GraphQlLD/</a></p><p>&gt; <i>GraphQL is a query language that has proven to be a popular among developers. In 2015, the GraphQL framework [3] was introduced by Facebook as an alternative way of querying data through interfaces. Since then, GraphQL has been gaining increasing attention among developers, partly due to its simplicity in usage, and its large collection of supporting tools. One major disadvantage of GraphQL compared to SPARQL is the fact that it has no notion of semantics, i.e., it requires an interface-specific schema. This therefore makes it difficult to combine GraphQL data that originates from different sources. This is then further complicated by the fact that GraphQL has no notion of global identifiers, which is possible in RDF through the use of URIs. Furthermore, GraphQL is however not as expressive as SPARQL, as GraphQL queries represent trees [4], and not full graphs as in SPARQL.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>In this work, we introduce GraphQL-LD, an approach for extending GraphQL queries with a JSON-LD context [5], so that they can be used to evaluate queries over RDF data. This results in a query language that is less expressive than SPARQL, but can still achieve many of the typical data retrieval tasks in applications. Our approach consists of an algorithm that translates GraphQL-LD queries to SPARQL algebra [6]. This allows such queries to be used as an alternative input to SPARQL engines, and thereby opens up the world of RDF data to the large amount of people that already know GraphQL. Furthermore, results can be translated into the GraphQL-prescribed shapes. The only additional requirement is their queries would now also need a JSON-LD context, which could be provided by external domain experts.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>In related work, HyperGraphQL [7] was introduced as a way to expose access to RDF sources through GraphQL queries and emit results as JSON-LD. The difference with our approach is that HyperGraphQL requires a service to be set up that acts as a intermediary between the GraphQL client and the RDF sources. Instead, our approach enables agents to directly query RDF sources by translating GraphQL queries client-side.</i></p><p>All of these RDFS vocabularies and OWL ontologies provide structure that minimizes the costs of merging and/or querying multiple datasets: <a href=\"https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/</a></p><p>All of these <a href=\"http://schema.org/Dataset\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">schema.org/Dataset</a> s in the \"Linked Open Data Cloud\" are easier to query than a schemaless graph: <a href=\"https://lod-cloud.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://lod-cloud.net/</a> . Though one can query schemaless graphs with SPARQL, as well.</p><p>For reference, RDFLib has a bunch of RDF graph implementations over various key/value and SQL store backends. RDFLib-sqlachemy does query parametrization correctly in order to minimize the risk of query injection. FOR THE RECORD, SQL Injection is the CWE Top 25 #1 most prevalent security weakness; which is something that any new spec and implementation should really consider before launching anything other than an e.g. overly-verbose JSON-based query language that people end up bolting a micro-DSL onto. <a href=\"https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-sqlalchemy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-sqlalchemy</a></p><p>Most practically, I frequently want to read a graph of objects into RAM; update, extend, and interlink; and then transactionally save the delta back to the store. This requires a few things: (1) an efficient binary  serialization protocol like Apache Arrow (SIMD), Parquet, or any of the BSON binary JSONs; (2) a transactional local store that can be manually synchronized with the remote store until <i>it's</i> consistent.</p><p>SPARQL Update was somewhat of an out-of-scope afterthought.

You're extending the definition by analogy and arguing that a company externalizing its costs is the same thing as a subsidy, but a subsidy implies direct and deliberate support.<p>This is important for a couple of reasons: The main one is that it's confusing to redefine subsidy when you can just say \"cost\" and have people understand you. People reading this survey might see the $5.2T number and assume that that cost is in addition to whatever the cost of climate change is and will have to read the paper to understand otherwise. This is unnecessarily confusing even if one were to grant the logic of it.</p><p>In addition, when people discuss subsidies, they are often most interested in government policy. The purpose of a subsidy often is to increase a certain kind of business, so we might worry about unnecessarily funding the fossil fuels and thus encouraging climate change in a manner above and beyond simply allowing them to be used the way we've always done, but that's not quite what's going on here.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that it's a lot easier to measure a genuine government subsidy than an externality. So the distinction matters in that regard as well. Any measure of the cost of climate change is to at least some degree speculation, whereas any attempt to measure the direct amount of money given to fossil fuel companies can probably be much more exact.</p>",

However given that we are comparing renewables to fossil fuels we need to be sure that we are measuring the same thing and to include externalities when measuring fossil fuels and not when measuring renewables is to be not measuring the same thing. (I actually got confused when I first saw the IMF link so I know my concern isn't hypothetical.)</p><p>Yes, I get that the case can be made that cost of using fossil fuels is more that the sum of direct gifts by the government to fossil fuel companies (fucking duh!) but that can be expressed without implying that governments gave $5.2T in tax dollars directly to fossil fuel companies in 2017. Where confusion is possible, it's best to make distinctions and clarify what is meant.</p>",

The point is that there is a distinction between a subsidy and an externality and that distinction is important. It's important for measurement reasons (The exact monetary amount a government spends on something is easier to measure than the indirect cost of a policy,) and for simple communication reasons. It makes no sense to talk about instituting a tax to cover a subsidy. You institute a tax to cover an externality. It also matters because there are ways of dealing with externalities other than taxes and subsidies and reducing the language makes this more confusing. It's especially confusing when the distinction is made in one discussion (about renewables) but not in the other (about fossil fuels.)</p><p>There is a term for using an unexpected definition for a word that already has a widely used definition during a discussion, that is a 'stipulative definition'. It's dishonest to do so without being clear upfront or in response to a discussion where the original definition is in use. This results in equivocation. Whether or not a subsidy is morally equivalent to an externality is a moot point if you're willing toss about with the language. My work involves financial reporting and if my employer asked for one set of numbers and I gave him another that I argued were 'morally equivalent' would pretty clearly be in the wrong, even if the point I was making about moral equivalence was correct.</p>",

I always create condaenvs (and avoid installing anything in the root condaenv) so that I can `conda-env export -f environment.yml` and clean that up.</p><p>BinderHub ( <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://mybinder.org/</a> ) creates docker containers from {git repos, Zenodo, FigShare,} and launches them in free cloud instances also running JupyterLab by building containers with repo2docker (with REES (Reproducible Execution Environment Specification)). This means that all I have to do is add an environment.yml to my git repo in order to get Binder support so that people can just click on the badge in the README to launch JupyterLab with all of the dependencies installed.</p><p>REES supports a number of dependency specifications: requirements.txt, Pipfile.lock, environment.yml, aptSources, postBuild. With an environment.yml, I can install the necessary CPython/PyPy version and everything else.</p><p>...</p><p>In my dotfiles, I have a <a href=\"http://setup_miniconda.sh\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">setup_miniconda.sh</a> script that installs miniconda into per-CPython-version CONDA_ROOT and then creates a CONDA_ENVS_PATH for the condaenvs. It may be overkill because I could just specify a different python version for all of the conda envs in one CONDA_ENVS_PATH, but it keeps things relatively organized and easily diffable: CONDA_ROOT=\"~/-wrk/-conda37\" CONDA_ENVS_PATH=\"~/-wrk/-ce37\"</p><p>I run `_setup_conda 37; workon_conda|wec dotfiles` to work on the ~/-wrk/-ce37/dotfiles condaenv and set _WRD=~/-wrk/-ce37/dotfiles/src/dotfiles.</p><p>Similarly, for virtualenvwrapper virtualenvs, I run `WORKON_HOME=~/-wrk/-ve37 workon|we dotfiles` to set all of the venv cdaliases; i.e. then _WRD=\"~/-wrk/-ve37/dotfiles/src/dotfiles\" and I can just type `cdwrd|cdw` to cd to the working directory. (Some of the other cdaliases are: {cdwrk, cdve|cdce, cdvirtualenv|cdv, cdsrc|cds}. So far, I have implemented cdalias support for bash, IPython, and vim)</p><p>One nice thing about defining _WRD is I can run `makew &lt;tab&gt;` and `gitw` to `cd $_WRD; make &lt;tab&gt;` and `git -C $_WRD` without having to change directory and then `cd -` to return to where I was.</p><p>So, for development, I use a combination of virtualenvwrapper, pipsi, conda, and some shell scripts in my dotfiles that I should get around to releasing and maintaining someday. <a href=\"https://westurner.github.io/dotfiles/venv\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://westurner.github.io/dotfiles/venv</a></p><p>For publishing projects, I like environment.yml because of the REES support.</p>",

These functions save and restore, respectively, the stack pointer, program counter, callee-saved registers, and any other internal state as required by the ABI, such that returning to a coroutine after having yielded restores all the state that would be restored upon returning from a function call. Minimalist implementations, which do not piggyback off the setjmp and longjmp functions, may achieve the same result via a small block of inline assembly which swaps merely the stack pointer and program counter, and clobbers all other registers. This can be significantly faster, as setjmp and longjmp must conservatively store all registers which may be in use according to the ABI, whereas the clobber method allows the compiler to store (by spilling to the stack) only what it knows is actually in use.</i></p><p>CPython's asyncio implementation (originally codenamed 'tulip') is written in C and IMHO much easier to use than callbacks like Twisted and JS before Promises and the inclusion of tulip-like async/await keywords in ECMAscript.

I reasoned that git internals are pretty simple and easy to understand, and that the supposedly obtuse interface makes a lot more sense when you approach it with an understanding of the fundamentals in hand. I said that the internals were so simple that you could implement a workable version of git using only shell scripts inside of an afternoon. So I wrapped up what I was working on and set out to prove it.<p>Five hours later, it had turned into less of a simple explanation of \"look how simple these primitives are, we can create them with only a dozen lines of shell scripting!\" and more into \"oh fuck, I didn't realize that the git index is a binary file format\". Then it became a personal challenge to try and make it work anyway, despite POSIX shell scripts clearly being totally unsuitable for manipulating that kind of data.</p><p>Anyway, this is awful, don't use it for anything, don't read the code, don't look at it, just don't.</p>",

Or maybe it's time for a binary representation again, just to be replaced with the next \"editor friendly and humanly readable\" format.</p><p>It all feels like, we as an industry took a step backward for years (instead of improving the given tools and specs) just to head to the same level of complexity all the while throwing away lots and lots of mature tooling of XML processing.</p><p>P.S.: Same goes probably for ASN.1 vs. XML Schemas... So now we are in the 3rd generation of schema based data representation: ASN.1 -&gt; XML -&gt; JSON..</p><p>P.P.S.: I'm not arguing that we all should use XML now, i'm reflecting over the historical course and what might be ahead of us. Clearly, XML is declining steadily and has \"lost\".</p>",

I certainly hadn't plagiarized, and it was up to me to refute that each identified keyword-similar internet resource on the internet was not an uncited source of my paper. I disengaged. I later wrote an essay about how keyword search tools could be helpful to students doing original research. True story.<p>Decades later, I would guess that human review is still advisable.</p><p>This need of mine to have others validate my unpaid work has nothing to do with that traumatic experience.</p><p>I still harbor this belief in myself: that what I have to say is worth money to others, and that - someday - I'll pay a journal to consider my ScholarlyArticle for publishing in their prestigious publication with maybe even threaded peer review (and #StructuredPremises linking to Datasets and CreativeWorks that my #LinkedMetaAnalyses are predicated upon). Someday, I'll develop an online persona as a scholar, as a teacher, maybe someday as a TA or an associate professor and connect my CV to any or all of the social networks for academics. I'll work to minimize the costs of interviewing and searching public records. My research will be valued and funded.</p><p>Or maybe, like 20% time, I'll find time and money on the side for such worthwhile investigations; and what I produce will be of value to others: more than just an exercise in hearing myself speak.</p><p>In my years of internet communications, I've encountered quite a few patrons; lurkers; participants; and ne'er-do-wells who'll order 5 free waters, plaster their posters to the walls, harass paying customers, and just walk out like nothing's going to happen. Moderation costs time and money; and it's a dirty job that sometimes pays okay. There are various systems for grading these comments, these essays, these NewsArticles, these ScholarlyArticles. Human review is still advisable.</p><p>&gt; <i>How can we identify biases in these objective systems?</i></p><p>Modern \"journalism\" recognizes that it's not a one-way monologue but a dialogue: people want to comment. Ignorantly, helpfully, relevantly, insightfully, experiencedly. What separates the \"article part\" from the \"comments part\" of the dialogue?

This should be done by reducing emissions as soon as possible, in order to \"achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases\" in the second half of the 21st century.

The fact of the matter is that an intermittent kWh is not as valuable as an on-demand reliable kWh to a utility who's number 1 priority is reliability. Even as solar is acquired at lower and lower prices, if evening power is generated by expensive and inefficient gas turbines, the customer might not see costs go down (and emissions might not go down either!). Solar is clearly economic in many markets, but we'll never get grid emissions in a place like California down much more without storage.",

So while you are right that a kWh of solar is not, on average, as valuable as a kWh of semidispatchable coal, the insane cheapness means that at some point, it is economical to massively overbuild renewable and decommission fossil fuel plants. You provide no evidence for the implausible claim that solar causes emissions to go up: your argument is only that the emissions reducing effect is muted, which may be true.<p>Also, while storage would be helpful, it is not the only way to enable a renewable transition. Additional transmission is enormously helpful: as the sun goes down on California, the wind is picking up in the Midwest. And don\u2019t forget demand response: if smart thermostats received price signals (maybe we should precool this house...) that would alleviate the evening ramp-up issue.</p><p>So I claim we\u2019ll need less storage than \u201ca whole day\u2019s usage\u201d. But the learning curve applies to batteries as well! This storage won\u2019t cost as much anyway.</p><p>The whole issue of intermittency is overrated. While a single solar <i>panel</i> might generate intermittently, the solar <i>fleet</i> across a whole state generates more predictably.</p><p>I am predicting that grid emissions will come down a lot over the coming decades. Partially I\u2019m predicting the past: they\u2019ve already come down, a lot!</p>",

Many packages make use of capabilities, such as CAP_NET_RAW being used for the ping binary provided by iputils.

Other than limiting the impact of resource exhaustion, cgroups are not a security feature of the Linux kernel.</p><p>Here's a helpful explainer of the differences between some of these kernel features; which, combined, have become somewhat ubiquitous:</p><p>From \"Formally add support for SELinux\" (k3s #1372) <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/1372#issuecomment-581797716\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/1372#issuecomment-5817...</a> :</p><p>&gt; <i><a href=\"https://blog.openshift.com/securing-kubernetes/*\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.openshift.com/securing-kubernetes/*</a></i></p><p><i>&gt;&gt; </i>The main thing to understand about SELinux integration with OpenShift is that, by default, OpenShift runs each container as a random uid and is isolated with SELinux MCS labels. The easiest way of thinking about MCS labels is they are a dynamic way of getting SELinux separation without having to create policy files and run restorecon.*</p><p>&gt;&gt; <i>If you are wondering why we need SELinux and namespaces at the same time, the way I view it is namespaces provide the nice abstraction but are not designed from a security first perspective. SELinux is the brick wall that\u2019s going to stop you if you manage to break out of (accidentally or on purpose) from the namespace abstraction.</i></p><p>&gt;&gt; <i>CGroups is the remaining piece of the puzzle. Its primary purpose isn\u2019t security, but I list it because it regulates that different containers stay within their allotted space for compute resources (cpu, memory, I/O). So without cgroups, you can\u2019t be confident your application won\u2019t be stomped on by another application on the same node.</i></p><p>From Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp</a> ::</p><p>&gt; <i>seccomp (short for secure computing mode) is a computer security facility in the Linux kernel. seccomp allows a process to make a one-way transition into a \"secure\" state where it cannot make any system calls except exit(), sigreturn(), read() and write() to already-open file descriptors. Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS.[1][2] In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.</i></p><p>... SELinux is one implementation of MAC (Mandatory Access Controls) that is built upon the LSM (Linux Security Modules) support in the Linux kernel. Some distros include policy sets for Docker hosts and lots of other packages that could be installed; see: \"Formally add support for SELinux\" (k3s #1372) <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/1372#issuecomment-581797716\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/1372#issuecomment-5817...</a></p>",

Risk is minimized by focusing on ROI.</p><p>Startups assume lots of risk and lots of debt and most don't make it. Liquidation preference applies as the startup team adjourns (and maybe open-sources what remains). In a large corporation, that burnt capital is reported to the board (which represents the shareholders) who aren't \"gambling\" per se. \"You win some and you lose some\" is across the street; and they don't have foosball and snacks.</p><p>How can large organizations (nonprofit, for-profit, governmental) foster intrapreneurial mindsets without just continuing to say \"innovation\" more times and expecting things to happen? Drink. \"Innovators welcome!\". Drink water.</p><p>\"Intrapreneurial.\" What does that even mean? The employee, within their specialized department, spends resources (time, money, equipment) on something that their superior managers have not allocated funding for because they want: (a) recognition; (b) job security; (c) to save resources such as time and money; (d) to work on something else instead of this wasteful process; (e) more money.</p><p>Very few organizations have anything like \"20% time\". Why was 20% time thrown off the island to a new island where they had room to run? Do they have foosball? Or is the work so fun that they don't even need foosball? Or is it worth long days and nights because the potential return is enough money to retire tomorrow and then work on what?</p><p>Step 1.

      "text": "Stephen, Jon, and Ashby here, the co-founders of Charityvest (<a href=\"https://charityvest.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://charityvest.org</a>). We created a modern, simple, and affordable way for companies to include charitable giving in their suite of employee benefits.<p>We give employees their own tax-deductible charitable giving fund, like an \u201cHSA for Charity.\u201d They can make contributions into their fund and, from their fund, support any of the 1.4M charities in the US, all on one tax receipt.</p><p>Using the funds, we enable companies to operate gift matching programs that run on autopilot. Each donation to a charity from an employee is matched automatically by the company in our system.</p><p>A company can set up a matching gift program and launch giving funds to employees in about 10 minutes of work.</p><p>Historically, corporate charitable giving matching programs have been administratively painful to operate. Making payments to charities, maintaining tax records, and doing due diligence on charitable compliance is taxing on HR / finance teams. The necessary software to help has historically been quite expensive and not very useful for employees beyond the matching features.</p><p>This is one example of an observation Stephen made after working for years as a philanthropic consultant. Consumer fintech products aren\u2019t built to make great giving experiences for donors. Instead, they are built for buyers \u2014 e.g., nonprofits (fundraising) or corporations (gift matching) \u2014 without a ton of consideration for the everyday user experience.</p><p>A few years back, my wife and I made a commitment to give a portion of our income away every year, and we found it administratively painful to give regularly. The tech that nonprofits typically use hardly inspires generosity \u2014 e.g., high fees, poor user flows, and questionable information flow (like tax receipts). Giving platforms try to compensate for poor functionality with bright pictures of happy kids in developing countries, but when the technology is not a good financial experience it puts a damper on things.</p><p>Charityvest started when I noticed a particular opportunity with donor-advised funds, which are tax-deductible giving funds recognized by the IRS. They are growing quickly (20% CAGR), but mainly among the high-net worth demographic. We believe they are powerful tools. They enable donors to have a giving portfolio all from one place (on one tax receipt) and have full control over their payment information/frequency, etc. Most of all, they enable a donor to split the decisions of committing to give and supporting a specific organization. Excitement about each of these decisions often strikes at different times for donors\u2014particularly those who desire to give on a budget.</p><p>We believe everyone should have their own charitable giving fund no matter their net worth. We\u2019ve created technology that has democratized donor-advised funds.</p><p>We also believe good technology should be available for every company, big and small. Employers can offer Charityvest for $2.49 / employee / month subscription, and we charge no fees on any of the giving \u2014 charities receive 100% of the money given.</p><p>Lastly, we send the program administrator a fun report every month to let them know all the awesome giving their company and its employees did in one dashboard. This info can be leveraged for internal culture or external brand building.</p><p>We\u2019re just launching our workplace giving product, but we\u2019ve already built a good portfolio of trusted customers, including Eric Ries\u2019 (author of The Lean Startup) company, LTSE. We\u2019ve particularly seen a number of companies use us as a meaningful part of their corporate decision to join the fight for racial justice in substantive ways.</p><p>Our endgame is that the world becomes more generous, starting with the culture of every company. We believe giving is fundamentally good and we want to build technology that encourages more of it by making it more simple and accessible.</p><p>You can check out our workplace giving product at (<a href=\"https://charityvest.org/workplace-giving\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://charityvest.org/workplace-giving</a>). If you\u2019re interested, we can get your company up and running in 10 minutes. Or, please feel free to forward us on to your HR leadership at your company.</p><p>Our giving funds are also available for free for any individual on <a href=\"https://charityvest.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://charityvest.org</a> \u2014 without gift matching and reporting. We\u2019d invite you to check out the experience. For individuals, we make gifts of cash and stock to any charity fee-free.</p><p>Happy to share this with you all, and we\u2019d love to know what you think.</p>",

      "text": "&gt; <i>FWIU, USB 3 is faster than FireWire</i><p>You've missed the point. The title of the article reads \"The tragedy of FireWire\" - how a good standard was victimized due to corporate politics. FireWire was 10 years ahead of USB. In 2002, FireWire 800 provided a data rate of 800 Mbps, full-duplex. On the other hand, USB 2 only had 480 Mbps, half-duplex. USB didn't catch up until 2010, after USB 3.0 was released. FireWire uses 30 V, 1.5 A power, and it supports power delivery up to 45 watts. USB didn't offer anything similar, not even the latest USB 3, until 2014 after Power Delivery and Type-C's standardization - and real applications only started to ramp up by ~2017. Both limitations of USB 2 were detrimental to some applications, e.g. using hard drives on a PC was painful due to speed and power constraints, had FireWire became more common, it would not be an issue. FireWire can also do everything Ethernet can do (in fact, 1394b's signaling is better than 100Base-TX Ethernet, and has lower radiation), networking is natively supported, you can network two computers together directly with a 1394 cable! On USB, it's only possible using an external controller. One application was NAS, a hard drive can be shared directly over 1394, and mounted as a local drive. Not possible with USB. Finally, 1394b does not have USB's 5-meter limitation due to protocol timing, and natively supports signaling over CAT-5 and fiber optics cable for a distance of ~50-100 meters - on USB, it requires a media converter running vendor-specific custom protocols and not interoperable. All of these features are standardized in 2004 in IEEE 1394b.</p><p>Of course, limitations are not inherently USB 2's failures, they have different applications, FireWire was more expensive, and USB's goal was low-cost. But the tragedy was that bad business decision prevented FireWire to achieve its full potential, slowly fading out, and eventually became irrelevant after USB 3 despite its initial good engineering.</p><p>FireWire was a tragedy.</p><p>&gt; <i>Due to DMA (Direct Memory Access) in most implementations, IEEE 1394 (\"FireWire\") can be used to directly read from and write to RAM.</i></p><p>This is why we need IOMMU.</p><p>You should not blame IEEE 1394 for DMA attacks just because it supports DMA. I agree that the tragedy of FireWire probably prevented a common PC exploit vector as an lucky unintentional consequence, but it's just a symptom, not the actual issue - and the symptom has came back in another form.</p><p>Most sufficiently fast hardware interfaces support DMA, and they're equally vulnerable - this includes PCI-E, ExpressCard (which exposes PCI-E), USB 4 (which exposes PCI-E port), Thunderbolt (which exposes PCI-E). Practical exploits are already widespread, not limited to arbitrary memory reads/writes, but also OptionROM arbitrary code execution if a Thunderbolt device is plugged in at boot time.</p><p>And this is not only a problem for external ports like 1394, USB 4 or Thunderbolt. Threats also exist from internal devices, like a Ethernet or Wi-Fi controller on the motherboard. While you cannot initiate a DMA transaction via Ethernet (without RDMA) or Wi-Fi since they don't expose PCI-E, the fact that those are connected directly to PCI-E implies any vulnerability in the controller firmware potentially allows an attacker to launch a DMA attack. Exploits already exist for Wi-Fi controllers.</p><p>This is the real problem. While the mechanism of IOMMU exists, CPU manufacturers and operating systems previously did little to systematically protect the system from DMA. In the past, Intel intentionally removed IOMMU functionality from low-end CPUs and motherboard chipsets in order to sell more Xeon CPUs to enterprise users. Also, while IOMMU is supported by operating systems, kernel code and drivers were not systematic audited for security - serious IOMMU bypass vulnerabilities have been previously discovered (and patched) in macOS and Linux's IOMMU implementations.</p><p>With continued proliferation of USB 4 and Thunderbolt, the lack of IOMMU and buggy driver implementation will become a bigger problem.</p><p>So far, QubesOS is most most protected operating system from DMA attacks. Untrusted hardware are assigned to a dedicated VM, and IOMMU is enforced by the hypervisor, not the individual device drivers in operating systems. Compromising a device driver in an untrusted domain does not directly expose the rest of QubesOS to attackers.</p><p>&gt; <i>and USB implementations do not use DMA.</i></p><p>USB 4 does now.</p>",

And eventually the Cupertino company effectively did kill FireWire, just as it seemed poised to dominate the industry.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Intel sent its CTO to talk to Jobs about the change, but the meeting went badly. Intel decided to withdraw its support for FireWire\u2014to pull the plug on efforts to build FireWire into its chipsets\u2014and instead throw its weight behind USB 2.0.</i></p><p><i>&gt; </i>Sirkin believes that Microsoft could have reversed the new licensing policy by citing the prior signed agreement. \"Microsoft must have thrown it away,\" he speculated, because it would have \"stopped Apple in its tracks.\"*</p><p>--</p><p>&gt; <i>Good to know that USB4 implementations are making the same mistake as FireWire implementors did in choosing performance over security.</i></p><p>DMA is optional and can be disabled.</p><p>Speaking of usability, DMA is limited to the Thunderbolt part (which is ultimately the PCI-E part) of USB 4 standard. You don't have to use USB 4's PCI-E. Unless the USB device really needs PCI-E, like RAID storage box or a GPU, disabling DMA is not a problem. Requiring explicit user consent for PCI-E is also a solution, operating systems already does it for Thunderbolt devices. Same treatment can be applied to USB 4.</p><p>And again, calling out DMA support is only shooting the messenger while ignoring the underlying problem. DMA is essential for any high-performance system bus, and it can a problem regardless of who supported it, or whether it's connected to an external port. A Wi-Fi controller handles untrusted data, but despite being an internal device on the motherboard, it's still potentially an exploit vector for DMA attackers.</p><p>&gt; <i>(or an OS with fuzzed IOMMU and also controller firmwares)</i></p><p>Only IOMMU is needed (and possibly a good driver, but not strictly required, see QubesOS). If your IOMMU is good, you don't have to trust firmware or hardware, since arbitrary DMAs are blocked by IOMMU, just like how memory protection (MMU) works but for I/O. Memory spaces are isolated.</p><p>The IOMMU vulnerabilities I previous mentioned are already patched, and a complete bypass of IOMMU is unlikely to occur in the future. Driver bugs are still an issue, more RAM regions can be exposed by drivers than what's really needed, and potentially you can pretend to be any hardware and feed bad data to trick the most vulnerable driver to expose more RAM regions, and I expect to see more bugs.</p><p>Turn on IOMMU, and apply OS patches often, and you'll probably be fine.</p>",

      "text": "&gt; <i>Wonder what the defaults</i><p>See the Thunderclap FAQ, most of your questions are explained. Thunderclap is <i>the</i> DMA attack on Thunderbolt, and everything should be applicable to USB 4 as well, since USB 4 incorporated Thunderbolt directly.</p><p><a href=\"https://thunderclap.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://thunderclap.io/</a></p><p>From the FAQ,</p><p>&gt; <i>In macOS 10.12.4 and later, Apple addressed the specific network card vulnerability we used to achieve a root shell. However the general scope of our work still applies; in particular that Thunderbolt devices have access to all network traffic and sometimes keystrokes and framebuffer data.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Microsoft have enabled support for the IOMMU for Thunderbolt devices in Windows 10 version 1803, which shipped in 2018. Earlier hardware upgraded to 1803 requires a firmware update from the vendor. This brings them into line with the baseline for our work, however the more complex vulnerabilities we describe remain relevant.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Recently, Intel have contributed patches to version 5.0 of the Linux kernel (shortly to be released) that enable the IOMMU for Thunderbolt and prevent the protection-bypass vulnerability that uses the ATS feature of PCI Express.</i></p><p>But note that Microsoft says on its website,</p><p>&gt; <i>This feature does not protect against DMA attacks via 1394/FireWire, PCMCIA, CardBus, ExpressCard, and so on.</i></p><p>Basically, IOMMU is enabled by default in most systems now. However, only on Thunderbolt devices (and USB 4 devices, since Thunderbolt is now its subset). But not on other PCI-E ports, such as the internal PCI-E ports, or external ones like 1394 or ExpressCard. I think it's due to fears of performance and compatibility issues, there's no reason why it cannot be implemented if one insists. Also, from the macOS example, you see that bad drivers can be a problem, even with IOMMU, if a driver is bad, attackers can exploit them and trick them to give more RAM access (If my memory is correct, Linux's implementation was better, but since it's an early FAQ, I don't know if macOS has improved).</p><p>&gt; <i>what the comparable parameters are for common consumer OSes.</i></p><p>On the Linux kernel, with an Intel CPU, the kernel option \"intel_iommu=on\" will enable IOMMU completely for everything, internal and external, which is the most ideal option. You should see</p><p></p><pre><code>    DMAR: IOMMU enabled\n</code></pre>\nin dmesg. Some people report compatibility issues for Intel's integrated GPU that causes glitches or system hang, use \"intel_iommu=on,igfx_off\" should fix it (which is not really a security problem, the GPU is already in the CPU). I've been running my PC with IOMMU for years by now. didn't notice any problem for me.<p>IOMMU needs support from the CPU and motherboard chipset, Intel's IOMMU is called VT-D and marketed it as I/O virtualization for virtual machines. Most i3, i5, and i7 CPUs are supported. You may need to turn it on in BIOS if there's an option. It should work on most laptops, even an old Ivy Bridge laptop should work - which is good news, laptops are the most vulnerable platform. Unfortunately, on desktops, Intel intentionally removed IOMMU from high-end CPUs preferred by PC enthusiasts in the 1st (Nehalem), 2nd (Sandy Bridge), 3rd (Ivy Bridge), and 4th (Haswell) generations, possibly as a strategy to sell more Xeon chips to enterprise virtualization users (likely in line with their cripple-ECC strategy). Most high-end overclockable K-series CPUs have their IOMMU removed, while the non-K counterparts are supported. Also, in these generations, some motherboard chipsets are crippled and don't have IOMMU. Fortunately, Intel no longer does it since 5/6th gen (Broadwell/Skylake) CPUs.</p><p>No experience on AMD yet, but it should be similar. I think possibly better, my impression is that AMD doesn't intentional crippling IOMMU or ECC like Intel does (a nasty strategy...). Check the docs.</p>",

      "text": "Hi HN, I developed Starboard over the past months.<p>Cell-by-cell notebooks like Jupyter are great for prototyping, explaining and exploration, but their dependence on a Python server (with often undocumented dependencies) limits their ability to be shared and remixed. Now that browsers support dynamic imports, it has become possible to create a similar workflow entirely in the browser.</p><p>That motivated me to build Starboard Notebook, a tool I wished existed. It's:</p><p>* Run entirely in the browser, there is no server or setup, it's all static files.</p><p>* Web-native, so no widget system is necessary. There is nearly no magic, it's all web tech (HTML, CSS, JS).</p><p>* Stores as a plaintext file, it will play nicely with version control systems.</p><p>* Hackable: the sandbox that your code gets run in contains the editor itself, so you can metaprogram the editor itself (e.g. adding support for other languages such as Python through WASM).</p><p>* Open source (<a href=\"https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook</a>).</p><p>You can import any code that targets the browser directly (e.g. puts stuff on the window object), or that has exports in ES module format.</p><p>I'm happy to answer any questions!</p>",

In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models.

In that sense, no, computers will never fully automate mathematical reasoning, because mathematical reasoning cannot be fully automated.<p>What we can automate, and have successfully automated many times over, is proof checking. In that sense, yes, computers have already fully automated mathematical reasoning, because checking proofs is fully formalized and mechanized.</p><p>I think that what people really ought to be asking for is the ease with which we find new results and communicate them to others. In that sense, computer-aided proofs can be hard to read and so there is much work to be done in making them easier to communicate to humans. Similarly, there is interesting work being done on how to make computer-generated proofs which use extremely-high-level axiom schemata to generate human-like handwaving abstractions.</p><p>I'm still not sure how I feel about the ATP/ITP terminology used here. ATPs are either of the weak sort that crunch through SAT, graphs, and other complete-but-hard problems, or the strong sort which are impossible. Meanwhile, folks have drifted from \"interactive\" to \"assistant\", and talk of \"proof assistants\" as tools which, like a human, can write down and look at sections of a proof in isolation, but cannot summon complete arbitrary proofs from its own mind.</p><p>Edit: One edit will be quicker than two replies and I tend to be \"posting too fast\".

At this point, I'm just going to quote WP:</p><p>&gt; The first [G\u00f6del] incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.</p><p>&gt; The second [G\u00f6del] incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.</p><p>&gt; Informally, [Tarski's Undefinability] theorem states that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic.</p><p>I recognize that these statements may seem surprising, but they are provable and you should convince yourself of them.

The relevance of the memristor lies in its ubiquitous presence in models which describe natural processes, especially those involving biological systems. For example, memristors inherently describe voltage-dependent ion-channel conductances in the axon membrane in neurons, present in the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model [16,17].</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Due to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics, it is not straightforward to describe a dissipative non-linear memory element, such as the memristor, in the quantum realm, since nonlinearities usually lead to the violation of fundamental quantum principles, such as no-cloning theorem. Nonetheless, the challenge was already constructively addressed in Ref. [18]. This consists of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment, where the coupling is changed based on the results of a weak measurement scheme with classical feedback. As a result of the development of quantum platforms in recent years, and their improvement in controllability and scalability, different constructions of a quantum memristor in such platforms have been presented. There is a proposal for implementing it in superconducting circuits [7], exploiting memory effects that naturally arise in Josephson junctions. The second proposal is based on integrated photonics [19]: a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer can behave as a beam splitter with a tunable reflectivity by introducing a phase in one of the beams, which can be manipulated to study the system as a quantum memristor subject to different quantum state inputs.</i></p><p>Quantum harmonic oscillators have also found application in modeling financial markets.

Higher-order interactive theorem provers enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present an interesting, open-ended challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning. We also present a deep reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, with strong initial results on this benchmark.</i></p>",

Within the realm of data management, I'd say \"metadata management\" [1] is the general category this fits within.<p>I would say, yes this idea is known/very common, as data architecture is as much about the descriptive language we use as anything.  I mean, \"business glossaries\", taxonomy, even just naming conventions [2] in coding, these are all related.</p><p>If you build enough databases/tables or even code yourself, you inevitably come across the \"how to name things\" problem [3].  If all you have to sort on for the \nknown meaning of a thing (column, table, file, etc.) is a single string value, then encoding meaning into it is quite common.  This way, a sort creates a kind of \"grouping\".  Many database vendors follow standard naming conventions - such as Oracle, for example [4].  It is considered a best practice when designing/building the metadata for a large system, to establish a naming convention.  Among other things, it makes finding things easier, as well as all the potential for automation.</p><p>You get all kinds of variations on this, such as, should the \"ID_\" come as a prefix or a suffix (i.e. \"_ID\").  One's initial thought is to use it as a prefix so all the related types group together, but then that becomes much more difficult if you want to sort items by their functional area (e.g. DRIVER_ID, DRIVER_IND, etc.).</p><p>One other place you see something similar is in \"smart numbers\" which is an eternal argument - should I use a \"dumb identifier\" (GUID, integer) or a \"smart one\" (one encoding additional meaning) [5].</p><p>I mean, basically, any time you can encode information in the meta-data of data, I think you can then operate on it by following \"convention over configuration\" (as mentioned elsewhere in the discussion comments).</p><p>The only problem I see is that such conventions can, at times be limiting - depending on the length of your metadata columns, and the variability you are trying to capture - which is why I believe, generally, metadata is often better separated and linked to the data it describes - this decoupling allows for much more descriptive metadata than one could encode in simple a single string value.  Certainly, you can get a long way with an approach like this, but I suspect you would run into 80/20 rule limitations.</p><p>Using naming in this way is a form of tight coupling, which could be seen as an anti-pattern in terms of meta-data flexibility, in some cases.</p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_management\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_management</a></p><p>[2] \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming...</a></p><p>[3] <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html</a></p><p>[4] <a href=\"https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/naming-conventions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/naming-conventions</a></p><p>[5] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_number\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_number</a></p>",

      "text": "I see the line of thinking you're going down.  There are ISO standards for data types, in a sense I could see why one would seek a standard language for defining the metadata/specification of a type as data.  Have to really think about that some more.. in a way a regex could be seen as a compact form of expressing the capability of a column in terms of value ranges or domains, but to define the meaning of the data, not so much.<p>Your interpretation of the atomic columns requirement is a little different than my understanding.  That requirement of normalization only applies to the \"cells\" of columnar data, it says nothing about encoding meaning into column names, which are themselves simply descriptive metadata.</p><p>I mean, for sure you wouldn't want to encode many values/meanings into a column name (some systems have length restrictions that would make that impossible, I'm not sure it makes sense anyway), but just pointing out that technically the spec does not make that illegal.  Certainly, adding minor annotations within the name of a column separated by a supported delimiter does not, in my opinion, violate normalization rules at all.  I mean things like \"ID_\" or similar.</p><p>Have you looked at INFORMATION_SCHEMA in SQL databases? [1]  You mentioned SQL metadata and constraints, that is as close to a standard feature for querying that information there is, some databases do it using similar but non-standard ways (Oracle for example).</p><p>Also, not standard but, many relational databases support extended properties or Metadata for objects (tables, views, columns, etc.) - you can often come up with your own scheme although rarely do I see people utilize these features.

There's a video by Jonathan Blow, creator of Braid and currently making a programming language called Jai, that talks about parsing expressions with order of operations. He gives an simple approach that apparently was discovered recently (though he didn't remember the paper name) that does this in a single pass and hardly any more complicated than what you wrote. You can see it here [1]. He also trashes on using yacc/bison before that and on most academic parsing theory.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnctEW1oL-E&amp;t=4578s\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnctEW1oL-E&amp;t=4578s</a></p>",

Knowing this, Thibado's group built their circuit with two diodes for converting AC into a direct current (DC). With the diodes in opposition allowing the current to flow both ways, they provide separate paths through the circuit, producing a pulsing DC current that performs work on a load resistor.</i><p>&gt; <i>Additionally, they discovered that their design increased the amount of power delivered. \"We also found that the on-off, switch-like behavior of the diodes actually amplifies the power delivered, rather than reducing it, as previously thought,\" said Thibado. \"The rate of change in resistance provided by the diodes adds an extra factor to the power.\"</i></p><p>&gt; <i>The team used a relatively new field of physics to prove the diodes increased the circuit's power. \"In proving this power enhancement, we drew from the emergent field of stochastic thermodynamics and extended the nearly century-old, celebrated theory of Nyquist,\" said coauthor Pradeep Kumar, associate professor of physics and coauthor.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>According to Kumar, the graphene and circuit share a symbiotic relationship. Though the thermal environment is performing work on the load resistor, the graphene and circuit are at the same temperature and heat does not flow between the two.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>That's an important distinction, said Thibado, because a temperature difference between the graphene and circuit, in a circuit producing power, would contradict the second law of thermodynamics. \"This means that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated, nor is there any need to argue that 'Maxwell's Demon' is separating hot and cold electrons,\" Thibado said.</i></p>",

The instant feedback, saving of partial program state, and visualizations mixed in are amazing and fun to work with.  The fact that it's taking place in a browser, you don't have modal editing with Vim, you don't get plugin support (like MyPy), and you don't have intellisense is a huge step backwards.<p>I'm hoping that someone addresses these issues, I know VSCode is trying, and Scala \"Metals\" worksheets are another similar concept (though different, it puts variable values in comments next to code as you update the code).</p><p>I feel like all of these are a step closer than what the Lighttable/Eve teams were shooting for, but not quite the next generation way of coding that it could be.</p>",

Water companies will vary pump operations for this reason and water pumping and treatment alone is 2% of electricity use.</p><p>Data centers definitely pay on a half-hourly settled basis but tend not to shift their workloads around to take advantage, some data centers will run their cooling systems in such a way as to reduce usage during the most expensive few half hours though. I have heard that larger users like Amazon, FB, Google, will automatically load balance between global centers to reduce electricity bills and carbon footprint.</p>",

      "text": "I recently purchased a home and spent some time improving ventilation in it this year. This is a home in Minneapolis, so just \"opening a window\" is not an option, as it would be too cold in the winter and dramatically reduce energy efficiency. Its effectiveness also changes based on factors like the wind, and the temperature difference between inside and out.<p>The general strategy for doing this right now with existing homes is to insulate your home as well as possible for energy efficiency, then install a continuous ventilation fan. This is essentially a bathroom fan, except that it runs all the time at a constant low speed, helping to circulate the air through and out your house by \"pulling\" a designed amount of air through the cracks.</p><p>I didn't want to punch a new hole in the house just to do this, and already had a bathroom fan installed, so as a hack I just turned it into a whole house ventilation fan with this: <a href=\"https://www.aircycler.com/pages/smartexhaust\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.aircycler.com/pages/smartexhaust</a></p><p>Basically you calculate how much CFM you need per hour based on the square footage of your house, and then you set it on the fan control. It still acts like a bathroom fan, except every hour it also runs for a set period of time (in my case, about 12 minutes).</p><p>The standard for this is ASHRAE 62.2. Use this to calculate the CFM for code: <a href=\"https://homes.lbl.gov/ventilate-right/step-3-whole-building-ventilation-rate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://homes.lbl.gov/ventilate-right/step-3-whole-building-...</a></p><p>Then the formula for calculating the fan run time is on this sheet: <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0221/7316/files/AC_DOC_7_0_SmartExhaust_Cut_Sheet_rs_20ce4f30-fa23-4dc0-a879-ce2e765fc31b.pdf?v=1593031639\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0221/7316/files/AC_DOC_7_0...</a></p><p>And presto, you have a ventilation system without having to do a lot of work. Do _not_ try this with a crappy, rusty old bathroom fan - clean or replace the motor first, and for extra credit, use an arc fault circuit interrupter on the breaker so if the motor fails it will blow the fuse instead of potentially causing a fire.</p><p>Note: This is really just to manage general air quality and VOCs. If you want to specifically make ventilation for COVID-19, that's a different problem. They focus on Air Changes per Hour (ACH), and a cubic feet calculation is used rather than square feet. There's no \"recommended amount\" of ACH for managing COVID-19. You're likely improving the situation by increasing it, but I wouldn't start inviting people over after you did it. ACH is very high in ICUs but staff are still getting sick there.</p><p>RE Humidity - ideal range varies based on region and outside temperature, but this chart roughly shows it: <a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mPz-jGdLpnPGgvWR3EgfvrhuT5mPgkKK_AQKZNzekzAyvsOGeFvGKK6Jn0kWGPEYYGkEAFM6CE3-BXLQzDEF_7_lV-H6HAfD5bXAl5HvUGB5rAjH9X1fPLLf8Q\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mPz-jGdLpnPGgvWR3Egf...</a></p><p>I have an on-furnace humidifier controlled by an ecobee for the winter, it's a huge quality of life improvement if you live in cold climates, but make sure to set it to \"frost control\" otherwise it won't lower the humidity based on the outside air and you can get mold in your walls. For summer, a standard house A/C combined with continuous ventilation should be sufficient to bring down humidity levels.</p><p>Finally, the \"correct\" air ventilation is a moving target with trade-offs and concerns of the moment. It was higher in 1925 (30cfm/person) to try to prevent tuberculosis and infectious diseases, then was lowered to 5cfm/person in the 70s during the energy crisis, and is currently at 15cfm/person. I imagine COVID-19 could make us re-consider the current recommendations. <a href=\"https://homes.lbl.gov/ventilate-right/ashrae-standard-622\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://homes.lbl.gov/ventilate-right/ashrae-standard-622</a></p>",

You can still have your cheap air purifier as long as the filter area is increased to decrease the effect of air resistance. Instead of using one 20x20x1 filter we'll use two 20x25x1 filters which increases the filter surface area over 250%. It's a little more expensive because you're using two filters instead of one but the increased filter surface area also helps the filter last longer before it gets clogged up and we're saving on energy use compared to a single filter.</i></p>",

The easiest setting is the one where the fan is as closed off as possible because it's pulling a vacuum. Less air, less resistance, easier to row / less power required to spin the fan. If anything, fans should draw less current with air flow on the inlet side restricted.</p>",

      "text": "&gt;The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock.<p>I joined a startup in 1999.  There were 3 founders and I was employee #2 after that.  I received a ton of options (this was before RSUs became popular).  We had a great product and a great team, but 18 months later ran out of money and unfortunately it was right after the dotcom implosion of early 2001 when funding had completely dried up.</p><p>My takeaway was that base salary is actually the most important component of TC.  Cash bonus based on some metric that you control comes second.  Equity comes third.  If you work for a FAANG, maybe equity can move higher up (though it remains to be seen how long this will be true).</p><p>Outside of FAANG (and top executives at F500 sized public companies) very few people are getting rich off of the \"equity\" component of their TC.  The vast majority of startups go bust before IPO or acquisition.</p><p>Time is the most valuable commodity you have, don't squander it for lottery tickets and empty promises.</p>",

If this trend continues the mining power will be so consolidated that a 51% attack will be likely. The Nakamoto coefficient is already at 4, and tending towards 3.</p><p>- energy usage due to Proof of Work is growing astronomically, and the higher the price of bitcoin, the less incentive there is to use renewable energy. Bitcoin uses more energy than the country of Argentina.</p><p>- transaction times are SLOW, and expensive. The lightning network is incredibly buggy and won't actually solve the problems it's promising.</p><p>There is a better alternative. RaiBlocks, named nano since 2018. It got a bad rap due to the BitGrail hack, but it's picking up steam again. The developer community is great, the main dev team on the Nano protocol has been consistently chugging along regardless of the 3 years of crypto winter on a shoestring budget and the nano community is made up of <i>users</i>, not speculators.</p><p>This article sums it up quite nicely: <a href=\"https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-stor...</a></p><p>I'm happy to receive downvotes, but all I ask in return is that you give it a read with an open mind.</p>",

That will certainly make it work!<p>Just look at the images in the article - the guy's best result was detecting a black speck appearing on a nearby white wall with some 60-70% reliability (based on his own numbers). So you would be missing a lot of mosquitoes - but will be happy firing the laser at random shadows and what not. And that was in a completely stationary setup and controlled lab conditions, i.e. not at all something resembling a typical poorly lit room!</p><p>This article is BS. Preprints are not peer reviewed (i.e. nobody has checked anything in it - so could even be a complete hoax), it is a pretty typical gadgetry style paper (we do it because we can, not because it makes sense) you do at when you need to fill up your resume with research papers (e.g. for keeping/obtaining a job reasons).</p><p>The \"save the world\" (mosquito control, diseases, etc.) justification is also par for the course for this type of crappy paper. Anyone who seriously thinks that one could control mosquito problem by shooting them one by one by a laser is delusional.</p><p>But neural networks and \"AI\" are being used, so it has to be cutting edge groundbreaking stuff, right?</p><p>BTW, this nonsense idea has been floated as a publicity stunt a few years ago (including a slow motion video of a laser burning off wing of a mosquito in flight) and it seems that some Russian PhD student from a fairly obscure uni either didn't do their research or has reinvented the wheel (or just plain copied the thing without attribution). The list of irrelevant or only very tangentially relevant (it is about mosquitoes, so in scope, right?) references is a dead giveaway there (paper on mosquitoes spreading zika? seriously?).</p><p>Here, it was even on National Geographic in 2010(!):\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKm8FolQ7jw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKm8FolQ7jw</a></p><p>Oh and that was supposed to be a handheld device to boot. With the same \"save the world from malaria\" spiel too. I wonder what are the owners of the company that was pushing this concept to investors back then trying to sell today ...</p><p>There are actually multiple videos on Youtube showing products from different companies that were attempting to push this as some sort of viable concept.</p>",

I'm not just parroting something I read, I've proved code to be 100% correct multiple times using formal verification (i.e. theorem proving) tools. That is, according to certain basic and reasonable assumptions, of course, like e.g. the hardware is not faulty or buggy while running the code, and that the compiler itself is not buggy, which would be a lot more rare than a bug in my code -- and even then, note that compilers and CPUs can be (and have been) formally verified.</p><p>Maybe you don't agree with my approach but I think it's the most realistic one for a project such as this and I am absolutely confident it would be practical, would completely eliminate most (i.e. more than 50%, at least) existing bugs with minimal verification effort (which almost anyone would be capable of doing with minimal training), and would steadily become more and more bug-free with additional, incremental verification (i.e. theorem proving) and refactoring effort.</p>",

The \"few things\" other than that are for alternatives to PKIX, which is fine and good, but PKIX will be with us for a long time yet.  As for Everest, it jives with what I wrote above, that verified implementations of TLS are feasible (Everest also implements QUIC and similar), but -surprise!- not listed is PKIX.<p>I know, it sounds crazy, really crazy, but PKIX is much bigger than TLS.  It's big.  It's just big.</p><p>The crypto, you can verify.  The session and presentation layers, you can verify.  Heck, maybe you can verify your app.  PKIX implementations <i>of course</i> can be verified <i>in principle</i>, but in fact it would require a serious amount of resources -- it would be really expensive.  I hope someone does it, to be sure.</p><p>I suppose the first step would be to come up with a small profile of PKIX that's just enough for the WebPKI.  Though don't be fooled, that's not really enough because people do use \"mTLS\" and they do use PKINIT, and they do use IPsec (mostly just for remote access) with user certificates, and DoD has special needs and they're not the only ones.  But a small profile would be a start -- a formal specification for that is within the realm of the achievable in reasonably short order, though still, it's not small.</p>",

      "text": "So the big problem with Git and SHA1 is that in many cases you are giving full control to an untrusted third party over the sha1 hash of something. For example, if you merge a binary file, it'd be quite easy for them to generate two different versions of the same file, with the same SHA1 digest, and then use the second version to cause problems in the future. You may also be able to modify a text file in the same way without getting noticed in review (I'm not up to speed on how advanced sha1 collision techniques are now).<p>Similarly, the git commits you merge themselves could have that done - the actual git commit serialization gives you a fair bit of ability to append stuff to it that isn't shown in the UI. That wouldn't affect the <i>signed</i> git commits. But it's still dubious to have the ability to change old history in a checkout.</p><p>Anyway, Git is apparently moving towards SHA256 support, so hopefully this problem will be fixed soon: <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/823352/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://lwn.net/Articles/823352/</a></p>",

You won't need a CAC reader on computers, for the most part, if you have mobile apps that can perform the identity proofing (such that's already done with examples like Apple's biometrics systems, FIDO2/WebAuthn, Apply Pay, etc). You'd still have the card for interfacing at endpoints (banks, postal service, IRS/SSA offices, other trust anchors and government services endpoints). I already login to my US CBP Global Entry account with <a href=\"http://Login.gov\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Login.gov</a> and 2FA, why can I not today use the same IAM system to login to my Social Security account?

I'm arguing for, admittedly challenging, digital ID modernization without disenfranchisement.

I doubt Red Hat would have made the change to CentOS that spurred all this if Scientific Linux hadn't decided not to continue and just use CentOS instead in 2019, because instead of a \"crap, we have to start a new distro to provide what CentOS did\" movement there would have been a much quicker and easier mass exodus to Scientific Linux.</p>",

We do recognize the limitations of lib2to3/fissix, though, so there have been some backburner plans to move Bowler onto LibCST, as well as building a PEG-based parser for LibCST specifically to enable support for 3.10 and future syntax/grammar changes.

      "text": "Thanks. There likely are relative  advantages to HTTP/3 QUIC. Here's this from Wikipedia:<p>&gt; <i>Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 use TCP as their transport. HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a transport layer network protocol which uses user space congestion control over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The switch to QUIC aims to fix a major problem of HTTP/2 called \"head-of-line blocking\": because the parallel nature of HTTP/2's multiplexing is not visible to TCP's loss recovery mechanisms, a lost or reordered packet causes all active transactions to experience a stall regardless of whether that transaction was impacted by the lost packet. Because QUIC provides native multiplexing, lost packets only impact the streams where data has been lost.</i></p><p>And HTTP Pipelining / Multiplexing isn't specified by just UDP or QUIC:</p><p>&gt; <i>HTTP/1.1 specification requires servers to respond to pipelined requests correctly, sending back non-pipelined but valid responses even if server does not support HTTP pipelining. Despite this requirement, many legacy HTTP/1.1 servers do not support pipelining correctly, forcing most HTTP clients to not use HTTP pipelining in practice.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Time diagram of non-pipelined vs. pipelined connection\nThe technique was superseded by multiplexing via HTTP/2,[2] which is supported by most modern browsers.[3]</i></p><p>&gt; <i>In HTTP/3, the multiplexing is accomplished through the new underlying QUIC transport protocol, which replaces TCP. This further reduces loading time, as there is no head-of-line blocking anymore</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining</a></p>",

I just spent some time last weeekend teaching someone the basics of how to create a new project. Such a simple idea required introducing the terminal, basic terminal commands, GitHub, git and its most common commands. It took about 3 hours for us to get through just the most basic pieces. Adding on ssh-keygen, key management adds even more friction.<p>It's certainly a difficult problem.

      "text": "If \"git pull --rebase\" succeeds without reporting a merge conflict, then it's tantamount to having executed the command with \"--ff-only\".<p>I believe you are incorrect however. \"git pulll --rebase\" will not <i>ever</i> rewrite history from the origin repository. It will <i>only ever</i> modify your local unpublished commits to account for new commits from the origin branch. If your change and the new commits from origin aren't touching the same lines or files, then the update is seamless [1].</p><p>If there is a conflict because your change and a new commit from origin both changed the same line in the same file, this can result in a merge commit that you need to resolve. But you resolve this <i>locally</i>, by updating your (unpushed, local) commit(s) to account for the new history. When you complete the merge, it will not show up as a merge commit in the repository -- you will simply have simply amended <i>your local unpublished commit(s) only</i> to account for the changes in upstream, and you will have seen every conflict and resolved each one yourself. When the process is complete, and you've resolved the merge, you'll have a nice linear branch where your commit(s) are on the tip of the origin branch.</p><p>The flag \"--ff-only\" basically just means \"refuse to start a local merge while performing this operation, and instead fail\".</p><p>Because of the potential for these merge conflicts, it's a best practice to \"git pull\" frequently, so that if there are conflicts you can deal with them incrementally (and possibly discuss the software design with coworkers/project partners if the design is beginning to diverge -- and so people can coordinate what they're working on and try to stay out of each other's way), instead of working through a massive pile of conflicts at the end of your \"local 'branch'\" (i.e. the code in your personal Git repo that constitutes unpushed commits to the upstream branch).</p><p>Additionally, all of the central Git repositories I've worked in in a professional context were also configured to disallow \"git push --force\" (a command that can rewrite history), for all \"real\" branches. These systems gave users their own private Git repo sandbox (just like you can fork a repo on GitHub) where they <i>can</i> force push if they want to (but is backed up centrally like GitHub to avoid the loss of work). This personal repo was very useful for saving my work. I was in the habit of committing and pushing to the private repo about once every 30m-1h (to eliminate the chance of major work loss due to hardware failure). Almost always I'd squash all of these commits into one before rebasing onto master, so that the change comes in as a single commit, unless it would be too large to review.</p><p>In the occasional circumstances where I've legitimately needed to rewrite history for some reason -- say credentials got into the repository, or someone generated one of these \"merge master into master\" commits -- then I would change HEAD from master to another branch, delete master, and then recreate it with the desired state. (And even that operation would show up in the system's logs, so in the case of something like credentials you'd additionally contact the security or source control team to make sure the commit objects containing the credentials were actually deleted out of the repo history completely, including stuff you can find only via the reflog.) Then contact the team working on the repo to let them know that you had to rewrite history to correct a problem.</p><p>I would recommend disabling \"git push --force\" for all collaborative projects. If you're operating the repository, you can do this by invoking \"git config --system receive\" and setting \"denyNonFastForwards true\". In GitHub there's probably a repository setting switch somewhere.</p><p>Once professional software engineers start working with Git all day long, they quickly get past the beginner stage and the need to do this kind of stuff is very rare.</p><p>[1] It doesn't mean the software will work though, even if both changes would have worked in isolation. You still need to inspect and test the results of \"git pull (--ff-only)\", since even if there are no conflicts like commits that modify the same lines as yours, or there are conflicts that Git can resolve automatically, it's possible for the resultant software logic to be defective, since Git has no semantic understanding of the code.</p>",

      "text": "Hi HN, my name is Anisa and I am the founder of Litnerd (<a href=\"https://litnerd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://litnerd.com/</a>), an online reading program designed to teach elementary school students in America how to read.<p>There are 37M elementary school students in America. Schools spend $20B on reading and supplemental education programs. Yet 42% of 4th grade students are reading at a 1st or 2nd grade proficiency level! The #1 reason students aren\u2019t reading? They say it\u2019s boring. We change that by bringing books to life. Think your favorite book turned into a tv-show style episode-by-episode reenactment, coupled with a complete curriculum and lesson plans.</p><p>1 in 8 Americans is functionally illiterate. Like any skill, reading is a habit. If you grew up in a household where you did not see your parents reading, you likely do not develop the habit. This correlates to the socio-economic divide. Two thirds of American students who lack reading skills by the end of fourth grade will rely on welfare as adults. To impact this, research suggests that we need to start at the earliest years.</p><p>I am passionate about the research in support of art and theatre as well as story-telling to improve childhood learning. Litnerd is the marriage of these interests. The inspiration comes from Sesame Street and Hamilton The Musical. In the late 60s, Joan Cooney decided to produce a children\u2019s TV show that would influence children across America to learn to read\u2014it became Sesame Street. Cooney researched her idea extensively, consulting with sociologists and scientists, and found that TV\u2019s stickiness can be an important tool for education. Lin-Manuel Miranda took the story of Alexander Hamilton and brought it to life as a musical. Kids have learned more about Hamilton\u2019s history thanks to Hamilton the Musical than any of their textbooks. In fact, this was the case so much that a program called EduHam is used to teach history in middle schools across the nation. When I heard that, the lightbulb went off and I decided to go all in on starting Litnerd.</p><p>We hire art and theatre professionals to recreate scenes directly from books in episode style format to bring the book to life, in a similar fashion to watching your favorite TV shows. We literally lead 'read out loud' in the classroom while the teacher/actor is acting out the main character in the book. We have a weekly designated Litnerd period in the schools/classes we serve and we live-stream in our teachers/actors for an interactive session (the students participate and read live with the actor as well as complete written lesson plans, phonetic exercises etc). We are currently serving 14,000 students in this manner.</p><p>The format of our program is such that if you don't complete the assigned reading and worksheets, you will feel like you are missing out on what is happening in later episodes. In this way, reading is layered in as a fundamental core to the program. Our program is part of scheduled classroom time.</p><p>A big part of our business involves curating content and materials that capture the interest and coolness-factor for elementary school students. We\u2019ve found that students love choose-your-own-adventure style stories, especially ones involving mythical creatures\u2014something about being able to have autonomy on the outcomes. So far, it seems to be working. We've even received fan mail from students! But we are obsessed with staying cool/relevant in our content.</p><p>Teachers like our product because it eases the burden placed on them. US teachers typically spend 4 to 10 hours a week (unpaid) planning their curriculum and $400-800 of their own money for classroom supplies. That's outrageous! When designing Litnerd, we wanted to ensure our product was not adding more work to their plate. Our programs are led by our own Resident Teaching Artists, who are live streamed into the classroom and remain in character to the episode as they teach the Litnerd curriculum built on top of the books. Our programs come with lesson plans, activity packets, curriculum correlations, educator resources, and complete ebooks.</p><p>Traditional K-12 education has extremely long sale cycles and is hard to break into. It can take years to become a contracted vendor, especially with large districts like NYC Department of Education. Because of my experience with my first YC backed startup that sold to government and nonprofits, coupled with my experience working at a large edtech company that built content for Higher Ed, I understand this sector and how to navigate the budget line item process.</p><p>Since launching in January, we have become contracted vendors with the New York City Department of Education (the largest education district in America). As a result, we\u2019ve been growing at 60% MoM, are currently used by over 14k students in their classrooms and hit $110K in ARR. Our program is part of scheduled classroom time for elementary schools\u2014not homework, and not extracurricular. Here\u2019s a walkthrough video from a teacher\u2019s perspective: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/9ffc59f0d7ed4a66964003703bba7b94\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.loom.com/share/9ffc59f0d7ed4a66964003703bba7b94</a>.</p><p>I am so grateful for the opportunity to share our story and mission with you. If you loved or struggled with reading as a kid, what factors do you think contributed? Also, if you have experience teachIng Elementary School or if you are a parent, I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how you foster reading amongst your students/children! I am excited to hear your feedback and ideas to help us inspire the next generation of readers.</p>",

But I like them. As you say, the editors take their role seriously. And it seems to have two valuable contributions.<p>Firstly, encouraging and structuring code review in academia. My own code is almost entirely solo (and messy), so a venue for structured review and an incentive to robustify public code is good. Secondly, the culture in some disciplines is that code is not citable, only papers - and JOSS is an end-run around this. I hope this second situation is changing, but we're not there yet so JOSS has a valuable role for the moment in simply being a 'journal' assigning DOIs basically for code packages.</p>",

Ergo, god does not value the sanctity of infants' lives over other concerns.</p><p>For citations of scripture, see e.g. \nFreedom from Religion Foundation &gt; What Does the Bible Really Say About Abortion?\n<a href=\"https://ffrf.org/component/k2/item/25602-abortion-rights\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://ffrf.org/component/k2/item/25602-abortion-rights</a></p><p>A very poor basis for morality and law, indeed.</p><p>What is \"Original Sin\" if not a suggestion that we should choose very wisely?</p><p>And when they rolled that [silver] rock from the tomb, behold what did they find? No dead baby; for the dead baby of god was in heaven, gentlemen. Sinless dead babies all go to heaven, gentlemen.</p><p>I think we can all agree that preventing unintended pregnancy is a worthwhile objective; though we have very differing views on whether abstinence-based education works. States with higher rates of religiosity (by church attendance) have higher rates of teen pregnancy: there is a somewhat strong positive correlation.</p><p>A standing prayer request: Pray that we might get healthcare to our congregation.</p>",

This makes it difficult to apply them to messy real world problems, which are typically complex and hard to distill into simple rules.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Model-based systems aim to address this issue by learning an accurate model of an environment\u2019s dynamics, and then using it to plan. However, the complexity of modelling every aspect of an environment has meant these algorithms are unable to compete in visually rich domains, such as Atari.  Until now, the best results on Atari are from model-free systems, such as DQN, R2D2 and Agent57. As the name suggests, model-free algorithms do not use a learned model and instead estimate what is the best action to take next.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>MuZero uses a different approach to overcome the limitations of previous approaches. Instead of trying to model the entire environment, MuZero just models aspects that are important to the agent\u2019s decision-making process. After all, knowing an umbrella will keep you dry is more useful to know than modelling the pattern of raindrops in the air.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Specifically, MuZero models three elements of the environment that are critical to planning:</i></p><p>&gt; <i>* The value: how good is the current position?</i></p><p>&gt; <i>* The policy: which action is the best to take?</i></p><p>&gt; <i>* The reward: how good was the last action?</i></p><p>&gt; <i>These are all learned using a deep neural network and are all that is needed for MuZero to understand what happens when it takes a certain action and to plan accordingly.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Illustration of how Monte Carlo Tree Search can be used to plan with the MuZero neural networks. Starting at the current position in the game (schematic Go board at the top of the animation), MuZero uses the representation function (h) to map from the observation to an embedding used by the neural network (s0). Using the dynamics function (g) and the prediction function (f), MuZero can then consider possible future sequences of actions (a), and choose the best action.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>MuZero uses the experience it collects when interacting with the environment to train its neural network. This experience includes both observations and rewards from the environment, as well as the results of searches performed when deciding on the best action.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>During training, the model is unrolled alongside the collected experience, at each step predicting the previously saved information: the value function v predicts the sum of observed rewards (u), the policy estimate (p) predicts the previous search outcome (\u03c0), the reward estimate r predicts the last observed reward (u).\nThis approach comes with another major benefit: MuZero can repeatedly use its learned model to improve its planning, rather than collecting new data from the environment. For example, in tests on the Atari suite, this variant - known as MuZero Reanalyze - used the learned model 90% of the time to re-plan what should have been done in past episodes.</i></p><p>FWIU, from what's going on over there:</p><p>AlphaGo =&gt; AlphaGo {Fan, Lee, Master, Zero} =&gt; AlphaGoZero =&gt; AlphaZero =&gt; MuZero</p><p>AlphaGo: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero</a></p><p>AlphaZero: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero</a></p><p>MuZero: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuZero\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuZero</a></p><p>AlphaFold {1,2}: \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold</a></p><p>IIRC, there is not an official implementation of e.g. AlphaZero or MuZero with e.g. openai/gym (and openai/retro) for comparing reinforcement learning algorithms? <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/gym\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/openai/gym</a></p><p>What are the benchmarks for <i>Applied RL</i>?</p><p>From <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28499001\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28499001</a> :</p><p>&gt; <i>AFAIU, while there are DLTs that cost CPU, RAM, and Data storage between points in spacetime, none yet incentivize energy efficiency by varying costs depending upon whether the instructions execute on a FPGA, ASIC, CPU, GPU, TPU, or QPU?</i> [...]</p><p>&gt; <i>To be 200% green - to put a 200% green footer with search-discoverable RDFa on your site - I think you need PPAs and all directly sourced clean energy.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>(Energy efficiency is very relevant to ML/AI/AGI, because while it may be the case that the dumb universal function approximator will eventually find a better solution, \"just leave it on all night/month/K12+postdoc\" in parallel is a very expensive proposition with no apparent oracle; and then to ethically filter solutions still costs at least one human)</i></p>",

However, the reality is a bit more complicated.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Yellowbrick visualizers often utilize more than just the method interface of estimators (e.g. `fit()` and `predict()`), relying on the learned attributes (object properties with a single underscore suffix, e.g. `coef_`). The issue is that when a third-party estimator does not expose these attributes, truly gnarly exceptions and tracebacks occur. Yellowbrick is meant to aid machine learning diagnostics reasoning, therefore instead of just allowing drop-in functionality that may cause confusion, we\u2019ve created a wrapper functionality that is a bit kinder with it\u2019s messaging.</i></p><p>Looks like there are Yellowbrick wrappers for XGBoost, CatBoost, CuML, and Spark MLib; but not for NNs yet. \n<a href=\"https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/contrib/wrapper.html#tested-libraries\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/contrib/wrapper.html...</a></p><p>From the <a href=\"http://RAPIDS.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RAPIDS.ai</a> CuML team: <a href=\"https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/</a> :</p><p>&gt; <i>cuML is a suite of fast, GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms designed for data science and analytical tasks.

RAPIDS provides users a streamlined approach where data is intially loaded in the GPU, and compute tasks can be performed on it directly.</i></p><p>CuML is not an NN library; but there are likely performance optimizations from CuDF and CuML that would accelerate performance of NNs as well.</p><p>Dask ML works with models with sklearn interfaces, XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, and TensorFlow: <a href=\"https://ml.dask.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://ml.dask.org/</a> :</p><p>&gt; <i>Scikit-Learn API</i></p><p>&gt; <i>In all cases Dask-ML endeavors to provide a single unified interface around the familiar NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn APIs.
