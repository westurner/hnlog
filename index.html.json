E.g. something like this (commands not tested, there may be typos):</p><p></p><pre><code>    mkfifo sda.fifo\n    echo 'sda.img f 444 root root cat sda.fifo' &gt; <a href=\"http://sda.pf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sda.pf</a>\n    dd if=/dev/sda bs=16777216 &gt; sda.fifo &amp;\n    mkdir empty\n    mksquashfs empty sda.squashfs -pf <a href=\"http://sda.pf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sda.pf</a>\n    mount -o ro,loop sda.squashfs /mnt\n</code></pre>\nYou then have an uncompressed image visible.  If it's a whole-disk image (/dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1), you need to use a program called kpartx to make device nodes for each partition.<p>I recommend reading the man pages and playing around with these utilities in a Virtualbox VM with a small disk.</p><p>Of course, this approach doesn't pay any attention to filesystems.  Which means it works with Windows partitions (unlike LVM or btrfs snapshots).  But there are limitations; it reads and stores \"empty\" space not occupied by files (I recommend making a large file full of zeroes beforehand to make the empty space compress better), restoring to a smaller disk is difficult if not impossible, restoring to a larger disk requires you to resize manually afterwards if you want to use the extra space.</p><p>[1] It's a little easier conceptually to make a squashfs directly from an image file, but that approach requires you to store the image file, which requires temp space equal to the size of the disk you're backing up.   The pseudo-file approach has a benefit of not needing temporary space equal to the size of the disk being backed up, you just need enough space for the compressed result.</p>",

Although comments on papers might be a dangerous area to venture into there are definitely places on the web where the ability to annotate and comment papers is helping science move forward. A good example is the Polymath project and Terry Tao's blog. Tao's recent solution to the Erdos discrepancy problem,an 80-year-old number theory problem, was actually triggered by a comment on his blog. Another example is <a href=\"http://www.fermatslibrary.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.fermatslibrary.com</a>. Although the papers in the platform are more historical/foundational, they were able to get consistently good/constructive comments that help people understand papers better.",

      "text": "&gt; <i>Why is everyone getting so caught up in the free part?</i><p>To restate my final point: there is nuance here, and people are missing it. I'm commenting for the purpose of interrogating the nuance, because I feel somewhat mixed on the issue. For online course material that is offered to enrolled students and required for the completion of a degree, I do not believe anyone is arguing in opposition. However, the collection and publishing of course material provided to enrolled students, then sharing it for free to non-enrolled students is a different matter entirely. The free part is an important detail in this particular matter and its circumstances, and shouldn't be wholly ignored, or treated as if it isn't part of the equation.</p><p>&gt; <i>If the lectures were a dollar would you say that they're obligated to subtitle them then?</i></p><p>Possibly. Most likely, only if paying for the material and following the courses was somehow tied to earning enrolled status and credit toward a degree, though. Because at that point, someone is actually a student looking to obtain something in exchange for studying the material, the university is engaged in the activity for which it receives federal funding, and we would rightly expect the institution to treat them as students according to the law and all its glorious regulations that seek to provide all students with a level playing field. Giving the material to the public at large with no fees or strings attached--meaning no strings attached <i>to either party</i>--isn't something I think we should discourage.</p><p>&gt; <i>Or do you have a specific cost threshold before you expect subtitles?</i></p><p>There is no cost threshold on my mind, no. There is only the threshold of whether the parties consuming the materials are enrolled students seeking a degree at the institution.</p><p>&gt; <i>... but they're also depriving disabled people of them ...</i></p><p>I'm not convinced this is true. The internet is full of freely available information from a variety of sources, much of it in video and audio form, and we do not have a longstanding debate centering on how much of the freely available information in video and audio form is depriving the hearing impaired of that information and should be made accessible. What's happening here is singling out a particularly easy target and asserting that they should be held to a different standard than all the other parties producing free, inaccessible content, and calling it \"depriving disabled people\" of the content. This stirs my something-isn't-quite-right detector, because we are attempting to provide a very narrowly scoped requirement onto a narrowly scoped party, on the basis of taking rules that inarguably apply to their services in one particular set of conditions, and applying them to another, quite different set of conditions.</p><p>&gt; <i>Also, are people forgetting that these are Harvard and MIT? The NAD isn't going to be suing your mom and pop website. Harvard and MIT can afford it and should be held to higher standards.</i></p><p>This is an argument from a pretty low set of standards, honestly. The ability of the party to afford increased accessibility sets up a rather disingenuous cash-gate on the issue, and completely debases the argument for accessibility into an argument about money. We're either concerned about establishing a proper set of guidelines and cultural expectations for making information accessible, regardless of its cost, or we're targeting entities with cash who are otherwise doing something we applaud, and saying because they have the means to do more, they <i>should</i> do more, and bringing the force of the state against them to compel them to do so. This is the kind of thinking that inexorably leads to crafting laws that target specific parties, leave open loopholes for other parties, and wind up subverting our intended goals by allowing those who wish to avoid a particular set of regulations and obligations by reorganizing under an uncovered entity type. We'd surely want to avoid such an outcome--even if it would help us better identify truly bad actors.</p><p>&gt; <i>I hate to use the word due to the anti-SJW frenzy the internet is in these days, but the ableism in this thread is appalling. No one is trying to see from the side of the NAD, with one user even suggesting that it just wants to line its coffers...</i></p><p>I don't think there is an appalling level of ableism in this thread. I am, and I think others are, trying to interrogate the issue from multiple perspectives, but we are coming to different conclusions (or are withholding conclusions) than you seem to expect. Perhaps that's because we're looking at the nuances of the circumstances.</p><p>From the NAD's perspective, I'm questioning and considering the affordances one ought to expect from information being made freely available in its original form, and what limitations can sensibly be agreed to exist--because it is insensible to expect there to be no limitations. This includes interrogating the alleged principles involved, and to what extent and to which parties they apply. When they don't apply equally to all parties, especially when they don't apply equally on the basis of one's ability to pay, I find the alleged principles reveal themselves to be suspect. This perspective, in particular, is the one in which the absence of affordances and obligations on information-releasing parties are felt most acutely. My lacking of a particular ability preventing me from equally enjoying informative and enlightening material is a bitter pill--especially if I can reasonably expect otherwise.</p><p>From the university and academia perspective, I am questioning and considering what reasonable thresholds one ought to be able to easily identify when releasing information in is original form freely to the public, or withholding it because additional accessibility affordances cannot reasonably be provided in light of the return on the time invested versus simply releasing the information. This perspective, in particular, is the one in which the force and burden of the obligations we levy as a society are felt most acutely. For instance, if a professor is teaching a course in which no persons enrolled have a disability, is the professor obligated to only use information which is accessible to serve the unknown contingent of internet consumers should the university decide to release the course materials freely on the internet? Are the lines only drawn at choosing videos with accurate captions? What about all the millions of people with other learning disabilities of some sort--what is the university obligated to do to ensure they are not \"depriving disabled people\" of this information? If other kinds of learning disabilities do not merit such affordances, why not? Why only this one or that one?</p><p>From the social and cultural perspective, I am questioning and considering what expectations and obligations we ought to hold in such cases for both parties, and how we should reasonably define these expectations for accessibility to as many people as possible and the obligations of implementation. Do we base our expectations and obligational determination on defining thresholds of sheer number of people who may potentially be affected by the lack of affordances? Do we only care about certain accessibility affordances, while ignoring others? Why or why not? We have, I think, passed the point of solving many of society's issues with hammers and saws. We now need scalpels. Much as medical science drastically improves outcomes by isolating bad things and eradicating them with precision, instead of simply removing a whole appendage, we need to pay attention to the nuances and rationally interrogate them to figure out what we think is best socially and culturally. If that's increasing the reach of federal disability law to cover information that is given away for free for the masses of internet consumers, okay. But we better establish some bulletproof and sane principles for doing so, and hold all information producers equally accountable. If we don't, then let's drop the veneer that we are holding all individual and organizational entities equally responsible and accountable, and admit we are instead targeting specific entities based on their perceived ability to pay for the increased obligation to be universally accessible.</p><p>Aside from feeling mixed in sum of all the above perspectives and not jumping to immediate and simplistic conclusions that ignore the nuances of circumstance, I continue to feel mixed because I think, as a principle, an accessible web is a better web. I hold firm to the principle that the more information people have access to, the better off they are, and the better a society is for providing this information as accessibly as possible to as many people as possible. However, I think there is also a somewhat disappointing need to include in our rational calculations when information producers, whomever they may be, are publishing that information as they have it, to put it out there, to share it widely with as many people as they can in the form it exists. Perhaps if we had better tools, we could abstract away the burden, then try taking the route of expecting entities to use certain technologies that alleviate the need to take on making things accessible on their own. If we make accessibility a social and cultural good and goal, how might that change how we produce information?</p>",

Something that you'd like to maintain over time? That may scale? Are you working alone on this or not? Is it an exercise to learn a new stack? I started a startup 4 years ago, asked a friend who's a ruby/rails dev for advice about tech/stack, his answer, yes rails is awesome but as you already know python go for Django as my goal was primarily to get stuff done business-wise not so much to learn cool new tech.

In this way it's very hard for me to lose track of anything, despite most of my work communication happening through email.

Here's a few things that help us:<p>- Make a rule that anything that's in master can be deployed by anyone at any time. This will enforce discipline for code review, but also for introducing changes that f.e. require migrations. You'll use feature flags more, split db schema changes into several deployments, make code work with both schema version, etc. All good practices that you'll need anyway when you reach larger scale and run into issues with different versions of code running concurrently during deployments.</p><p>- If you're using Github, check out the recently added options for controlling merging. Enable branch protection for master, so that only pull request that are green on CI and have been reviewed can be merged. Enable different dropdown options for the merge button (eg rebase and merge), these are useful for small changes.</p><p>- It takes some time to get used to those constraints. Make sure that everyone is on board, and do a regular review of the workflow just as you would review your code. It takes some time to get used to, but I think it's worth it in the long run.</p>",

The code is generally messy and horrible, rife with race conditions and barely holding together in parts. (Biggest: 30k LOC.) While I'm proud of my work \u2014 especially design-wise \u2014 I feel most of my time was spent on battling stupid bugs. I haven't gained any specialist knowledge \u2014 just bloggable API experience. There's nothing I could write a book about.</p><p>Meanwhile, when I compulsively dig through one-man frameworks like YapDatabase, Audiobus, or AudioKit, I am left in awe! They're brimming with specialist knowledge. They're incredibly documented and organized. Major features were added over the course of weeks! People have written books <i>about</i> these frameworks, and they were created by my peers \u2014 probably alongside other work. Same with one-man apps like Editorial, Ulysses, or GoodNotes.</p><p>I am utterly baffled by how knowledgeable and productive these programmers are. If I'm dealing with a new topic, it can take weeks to get a lay of the land, figure out codebase interactions, consider all the edge cases, etc. etc. But the commits for these frameworks show that the devs basically worked through their problems over mere days \u2014 to say nothing of getting the overall architecture right from the start. An object cache layer for SQL? Automatic code gen via YAML? MIDI over Wi-Fi? Audio destuttering? Pff, it took me like a month to add copy/paste to my app!</p><p>I'm in need of some recalibration. Am I missing something? Is this quality of work the norm, or are these just exceptional programmers? And even if they are, how can I get closer to where they're standing? I don't want to wallow in my mediocrity, but the mountain looks almost insurmountable from here! No matter the financial cost or effort, I want to make amazing things that sustain me financially; but I can't do that if it takes me ten times as long to make a polished product as another dev. How do I get good enough to consistently do work worth writing books about?</p>",

But that odd-looking dual lens is the scanner, basically the embedded version of the SCiO. It uses spectrometry to shine near-infrared light on objects \u2014 fruit, liquids, medicine, even your body \u2014 to analyze them.<p>&gt; Say you're at at the supermarket and you want to check how fresh the tomatoes are. Instead of squeezing them, you'd just launch the SCiO app, hold the scanner up to the skin of the tomato, and it will tell you how fresh it is on a visual scale. Do the same thing to your body and you can check your body mass index (BMI). You need to specify the thing you're scanning at the outset, and the actually analysis is performed in the cloud, but the whole process is a matter of seconds, not minutes.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy</a></p><p>...

      "text": "In tech circles, it seems that Bayesian statistics is often favored over classical frequentist statistics. In my study of both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, it seems that the results of a Bayesian analysis are generally more intuitive, such as when comparing Bayesian credible intervals to frequentist confidence intervals. It also seems like Bayesian analysis avoids what I think is one of the most serious problems in analysis, the multiple comparisons problem. It's been easy for me to find any number of Bayesian critiques of frequentist stats, but I have rarely seen frequentist defenses against Bayesian stats. This may simply be because I mostly read technology related sites as opposed to more general statistics oriented sites. As such, I would really appreciate hearing some frequentist critiques of Bayesian stats. I feel like the situation can't be as cut and dry as one being better than the other in all things, so I would like to acquire a more balanced perspective by hearing about the other side. Thanks!",

A crucial facet of the problem faced by Bayesian logicism involves how the logic is supposed to apply to scientific contexts where the conclusion sentence is some hypothesis or theory, and the premises are evidence claims. The difficulty is that in any probabilistic logic that satisfies the usual axioms for probabilities, the inductive support for a hypothesis must depend in part on its prior probability. This prior probability represents how plausible the hypothesis is supposed to be based on considerations other than the observational and experimental evidence (e.g., perhaps due to relevant plausibility arguments). A Bayesian logicist must tell us how to assign values to these pre-evidential prior probabilities of hypotheses, for each of the hypotheses or theories under consideration. Furthermore, this kind of Bayesian logicist must determine these prior probability values in a way that relies only on the syntactic logical structure of these hypotheses, perhaps based on some measure of their syntactic simplicities. There are severe technical problems with getting this idea to work. Moreover, various kinds of examples seem to show that such an approach must assign intuitively quite unreasonable prior probabilities to hypotheses in specific cases (see the footnote cited near the end of section 3.2 for details). Furthermore, for this idea to apply to the evidential support of real scientific theories, scientists would have to formalize theories in a way that makes their relevant syntactic structures apparent, and then evaluate theories solely on that syntactic basis (together with their syntactic relationships to evidence statements). Are we to evaluate alternative theories of gravitation (and alternative quantum theories) this way?</p>",

Came across this 2009 HN thread, \"Ask HN: What can't you do in Excel?\" from pg:<p>&gt; One of the startups in the current YC cycle is making a new, more powerful spreadsheet. If there are any Excel power users here, could you please describe anything you'd like to be able to do that you can't currently? Your reward could be to have some very smart programmers working to solve your problem.</p><p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=429477\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=429477</a></p><p>What significant advances -- in Excel/spreadsheets, not the Turing-complete thing -- have been made in the 8 years since? What's the YC startup from that cycle that \"is making a new, more powerful spreadsheet\", and what is it doing today? I remember Grid [0], but that was from 2012. Any other companies make innovations that would overturn the spreadsheet paradigm, or at least be copied by Excel/OO/GSheets?</p><p>A commenter mentioned \"Queries\", since many spreadsheet users use spreadsheets like a database. I just recently noticed that GSheets has a QUERY function [1] that uses \"principles of Structured Query Language (SQL) to do searches). The function has been around since 2015 (according to Internet Archive [2]) so perhaps I ignored it because its description then was simply, \"Runs a Google Visualization API Query Language query across data.\"</p><p>It appears that \"Visualization API Query Language\" has a lot of SQL-type features with the immediately obvious exception of joins [3].</p><p>edit: Multiple people said they would like Excel to have online functionality, i.e. like Google Sheets, but being able to accept VBA and any other features of legacy Excel spreadsheets. There's now Excel Online but I haven't used it (still sticking to Office 2011 for Mac if I ever need to use Excel instead of GS). How seamless is the transition from offline, legacy Excel files to online Excel?</p><p>[0] <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/grid-yc-s12-reinvents-the-spreadsheet-for-the/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://blog.ycombinator.com/grid-yc-s12-reinvents-the-spreadsheet-for-the/</a></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093343?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093343?hl=en</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150319144449/https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093343?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://web.archive.org/web/20150319144449/https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093343?hl=en</a></p><p>[3] <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage</a></p>",

For instance, if asked to list all steps involved in starting a car, most people would say:</p><p>- turn key\n- start car</p><p>That could turn into an infinite loop, though. A better way would be:</p><p>- turn key\n- start car\n- if it starts, exit\n- if it doesn't start, repeat 3 more times\n- if it still won't start, call a mechanic</p><p>Stuff like this\u2014that anyone can understand, that can be explained without looking at a computer, but that it's still useful.</p><p>Any idea what I could talk about?

      "text": "I'd love to hear some thoughts about keeping a \"lab notebook\" for ML experiments. I use Jupyter Notebooks when playing around with different ML models, and I find that it really helps to document my thought process with notes and comments. It also seems that the ML workflow is very 'experiment' driven. I'm always thinking \"Hm, I think if I tweak this hyperparameter this way, or adjust this layer this way, then I'll get a better result because X\". Thus, I have a bit of a hypothesis and proposed experiment. I run that model, and see if it improved or not.<p>Then, I run into an issue where I can either: 1. overwrite the original model with my new hyperparameters/design and re-run and analyze or 2. keep adding to the same notebook \"page\" with a new hypothesis/test/analysis loop, thus making the notebook pretty large. With number 1, I often want to backtrack and re-reference how a previous experiment went, but I lose that history. With number 2, it seems to get big pretty quickly, and coming back to the same notebook requires more setup, and \"searching\" the history gets more cumbersome.</p><p>Does anyone try using a separate notebook page for each experiment, maybe with a timestamp or \"version\"? Or is there a better way to do this in a single notebook? I am thinking that something like \"chapters\" could help me here, and it seems like this extension might help me: <a href=\"https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions#table-of-contents\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions#table-of-content...</a></p>",

(One of the Top 25 most frequent vulnerabilities). This is especially important because <i>most</i> apps GRANT both UPDATE and DELETE; if not CREATE TABLE and DROP TABLE to the sole app account.</p><p>- Make it much easier to port to a new database; or run tests with SQLite. With raw SQL, you need the table schema in your head and either comprehensive test coverage or to review every single query (and the whole function preceding db.execute(str, *params))</p><p>- May be the performance bottleneck for certain queries; which you can identify with code profiling and selectively rewrite by hand if adding an index and hinting a join or lazifying a relation aren't feasible with the non-SQLAlchemy ORM that you must use.</p><p>- Should provide a way to generate the query at dev or compile-time.</p><p>- Should make it easy to DESCRIBE the query plans that code profiling indicates are worth hand-optimizing (learning SQL is sometimes not the same as learning how a particular database plans a query over tables without indexes)</p><p>- Make managing db migrations pretty easy.</p><p>- SQLAlchemy really is great. SQLAlchemy has eager loading to solve the N+1 query problem. Django is often more than adequate; and has had prefetch_related() to solve the N+1 query problem since 1.4. Both have an easy way to execute raw queries (that all need to be reviewed for migrations). Both are much better at paging without allocating a ton of RAM for objects and object attributes that are irrelevant now.</p><p>- Make denormalizing things from a transactional database with referential integrity into JSON really easy; which webapps and APIs very often need to do.</p><p>Is there a good JS ORM?

One constraint is that demand and supply must balance. The grid can\u2019t store much energy. Oversupply can cause grid frequency to go above 50/60 Hz, threatening grid stability: <a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/ebf483/node/705\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.e-education.psu.edu/ebf483/node/705</a>. Power prices go negative when there is too much generation capacity online at a given instant, relative to demand. That creates incentives for generators that can shut down (like natural gas) to do so.</p><p>Negative power prices are not a good thing for consumers. A negative price in the wholesale electric markets does not mean the electricity is \"less than free.\" Obviously, even wind power or solar always costs positive money to generate in real terms. Instead, it signals a mismatch between generation capacity, storage capacity, and demand. In a grid with adequate storage capacity, negative prices would be extremely rare.</p>",

But in practice their bill should stay the same, even if there were significant periods during which energy prices were negative. Why? The negative prices don't indicate that the cost of power production is negative for the power company, so the power company is losing money. The power company has to recoup those losses <i>somehow,</i> and they do it by charging more when power prices are positive.</p><p>In order to take advantage of negative power prices, a power consumer would have to dynamically increase their power consumption in response to the negative prices. If they have any significant power storage capacity, maybe they could store power and sell it back to the grid when prices go positive, or maybe turn on their mining rig while prices are negative, if they go negative frequently.</p>",

Electricity costs can be 30-70% of their total costs of operation.<p>&gt; [...] If Bitcoin mining really does begin to consume vast quantities of the global electricity supply it will, it follows, spur massive growth in efficient electricity production\u2014i.e. the green energy revolution. Moore\u2019s Law was partially a story about incredible advances in materials science, but it was also a story about incredible demand for computing that drove those advances and made semiconductor research and development profitable. If you want to see a Moore\u2019s-Law-like revolution in energy, then you should be rooting for, and not against, Bitcoin. The fact is that the Bitcoin network, right now, is providing a $200,000 bounty every 10 minutes (the mining reward) to the person who can find the cheapest energy on the planet.</p>",

Using indicators designed to measure a \u2018safe and just\u2019 development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2\u20136 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.</p><p>&gt; \"Radical changes are needed if all people are to live well within the limits of the planet,\" [...]</p><p>&gt; \"These include moving beyond the pursuit of economic growth in wealthy nations, shifting rapidly from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and significantly reducing inequality.</p><p>&gt; \"Our physical infrastructure and the way we distribute resources are both part of what we call provisioning systems.

This got me thinking: would a website admin (ex. small business owner with a custom website) benefit from a service that validates user passwords? The idea is to create a registration iframe with forms for email, password, etc., which would check hashed credentials against a database of data from breaches. Additionally, client-side validation would enforce rules recommended by the NIST's Digital Identity Guidelines [1], which would relieve admins from implementing their own rules. I'm sure there are additional security features that can be added.<p>1. Have you seen a need for this type of service, and could you see this being adopted at all?</p><p>2.

And then everyone else comes surging in with hate, disrespect, and vitriol; unhealthy. They don't even realize that being hateful and disrespectful is making them more depressed. They think that complaining and talking smack to people is changing the world. And then they turn off the phone or log out of the computer, and carry on with their lives.</p><p>No-one taught them to be the positive, helpful energy they want to attract from the world. No-one properly conditioned them to either respectfully disagree according to the data or sit down and listen. No-one explained to them that a well-founded argument doesn't fit in 140 or 280 characters, but a link and a headline do. No-one explained to them that what they write on the internet lasts forever and will be found by their future interviewers, investors, jurors, and voters. No-one taught them that being respectful and helpful in service of other people - of the group's success, of peaceful coexistence - is the way to get ahead AND be happy. \"No-one told me that.\"</p><p>Shareholders of public corporations want to see growth in meaningless numbers, foreign authoritarian governments see free expression as a threat to their ever-so-fragile self-perceptions, political groups seek to frame and smear and malign and discredit (because they are so in need of group acceptance; because money still isn't making them happy), and there are children with too much free time reading all of these.</p><p>No-one is holding these people accountable: we need transparency and accountability. We need to focus on more important goals and feel good about helping; about volunteering our time to help others be happier.</p><p>Instead, now that these haters and scam artists have all self-identified, we must spend our time conditioning their communications until they learn to respectfully disagree on facts and data or go somewhere else. \"That's how you feel? Great. How does that make your victim feel?\" is the confrontation that some people are seeking from companies that set out to serve free speech and provide a forum for citizens to share the actual news.</p><p>Who's going to pay for that? Can they sue for their costs and losses? Advertisers do not want a spot next to hateful and disrespectful.</p><p>\"How dare you speak of censorship in such veiled terms!?\" Really? They're talking about taking down phrases like \"kill\" and \"should die\"; not phrases like \"I disagree because:\"</p><p>So, now, because there are so many hateful economically disadvantaged people in the world with nothing better to do and no idea how to run a business or keep a job with benefits, these companies need to staff 24 hour a day censors to take down the hate and terror and gang recruiting <i>within one hour</i>. What a distorted mirror of our divisively fractured wealth inequality, indeed.</p><p>\"Ban gangs ASAP, please: they'll just go away\"</p><p>How much does it cost to pay prison labor to redundantly respond to this trash? Are those the skills they need to choose a different career with benefits and savings that meet or exceed inflation when they get out?</p><p>What is the procedure for referring threats of violence to justice in your jurisdiction? Are there wealthy individuals in your community who would love to contribute resources to this effort? Maybe they have some region-specific pointers for helping the have-nots out here trolling like it's going to get them somewhere they want to be in life?</p><p>Let me share a little story with you:</p><p>A person walks into a bar/restaurant, flicks off the bartender/waiter, orders 5 glasses of free water, starts plastering ads to the walls and other peoples' tables, starts making threats to groups of people cordially conversing, and walks out.</p>",

The examples shown are amazingly, unbelievably good!  Really GREAT WORK.<p>Based on a quick skim of the paper, here is my oversimplified description of how this works:</p><p>During training, an agent navigates an artificial 3D scene, observing multiple 2D snapshots of the scene, each snapshot from a different vantage point.  The agent passes these snapshots to a deep net composed of two main parts: a representation-learning net and a scene-generation net. The representation-learning net takes as input the agent's observations and produces a scene representation (i.e., a lower-dimensional embedding which encodes information about the underlying scene).  The scene-generation network then predicts the scene from three inputs: (1) <i>an arbitrary query viewpoint</i>,  (2) the scene representation, and (3) stochastic latent variables. The two networks are trained jointly, end-to-end, to maximize the likelihood of generating the ground-truth image that would be observed from the query viewpoint.  See Figure 1 on Page 15 of the Open Access version of the paper.  Obviously I'm playing loose with language and leaving out numerous important details, but this is essentially how training works, as I understand it based on a first skim.</p><p>EDIT: I replaced \"somewhat obvious\" with \"natural,\" which better conveys what I actually meant to write the first time around.</p>",

I could specify that a particular game entity was subject to gravity or not, etc.</p><p>The resulting performance was fantastic and I found I could have many thousands of on-screen objects at the time with no hiccups. The design also made it really easy to save and replay game state; just save or serialize the single state table and input for each frame.</p><p>The final optimization would have been to write a language that would define game entities in terms of the game components they were subject to and automatically generate the single class that was union of all possible types and would be a \"row\" in the table. I didn't get around to that because it just wasn't necessary for the simple game I made.</p><p>I was inspired to do this from various articles about \"component based game design\" published at the time that were variations on this technique, and the common thread was that a hierarchical OO structure ended up adding a lot of unneeded complexity for games that hindered flexibility as requirements changed or different behaviors for in-game entities were added.</p><p>Edit: This is a good article on the approach. <a href=\"http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy...</a></p>",

Because they're unable to store this extra energy, they temporarily shut down solar and wind and leave the polluting plants online.</p><p>Consumers aren't exposed to daily price fluctuations: they get a flat rate that makes it easy to check their bill; so there's no price incentive to e.g. charge an EV at midday when energy is cheapest.</p><p>The 'Duck curve' shows this relation between peak supply and demand in electricity markets:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve</a></p><p>Developing energy storage capabilities (through infrastructure and open access basic research that can be capitalized by all) is likely the best solution. According to a fairly recent report, we could go 100% renewable with the energy storage tech that exists today.</p><p>But there's no money for it. There's money for subsidizing oil production (regardless of harms (!)), but not so much for wind and solar. There's money for responding to natural disasters caused by global warming, but not so much for non-carbon-based energy sources that don't cause global warming. A film called \"The Burden: Fossil Fuel, the Military, and National Security\" quotes the actual unsubsidized price of a gallon of gasoline.</p><p>Wouldn't it be great if there was some kind of computer workload that could be run whenever energy is cheapest ( '<i>energy spot instances</i>') so that we can accelerate our migration to renewable energy sources that are saving the environment for future generations? If there were people who had strong incentives to create demand for power-efficient chips and inexpensive clean energy.</p><p>Where would be if we had continued with Jimmy Carter's solar panels on the roof of the White House (instead of constant war and meddling with competing oil production regions of the world)?</p><p>It's good to see wind and solar growing this fast this year. A chart with cost per kWhr or MWhr would be enlightening.</p>",

But Naam said even if you take away that credit, <i>\u201cthese bids, un-subsidized, are still cheaper than any new coal or gas plants, and possibly cheaper than operating existing plants.\u201d</i></p><p>I'm assuming that's without factoring in the health cost externalities.</p>",

At first it's a very strange idea, afterall we work and consume everyday in order to grow the economy. But every healthy system as a homeostastic point, a point where it doesn't need to grow, only to be maintained. \nWe are now a fat society and we need to get our health back, we need to degrow. We need to work much less hours and consume much less. Reducing working hours is a great leverage point. People will start to have time to care about the community, and take care of their own health. Maybe have more time to take a walk instead of using the car. This can improve health and environment but will not contribute to economic growth, healthy people that don't use cars are not good friends of economic growth based on GDP.\nEnglish is not my mother language, Ursula Le Guin had an eloquent post about this on her blog, but was removed to be on the last book. The post is called \"Clinging to a Metaphor\" (the metaphor is economic growth) and the book is called \"No Time to Spare\".\n[1] <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kz9wjJjmkmc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/kz9wjJjmkmc</a>",

      "text": "The actual document title: \"Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 drafted by the Group of independent scientists:\nInvited background document on economic transformation, to chapter:\nTransformation: The Economy\" (2018)\n<a href=\"https://bios.fi/bios-governance_of_economic_transition.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://bios.fi/bios-governance_of_economic_transition.pdf</a> [PDF]<p>Why I distrust command economies (beyond just because of our experiences with violent fascism and defense overspending and the subsequent failures of various communist regimes):</p><p>We have elections today. We don't choose to elect people that regard the environment (our air, water, land, and other natural resources) as our most important focus. A command economy driven by these folks for longer than a term limit would be even more disastrous.</p><p>The market does not solve for 'externalities': things that aren't costed in. We must have regulation to counteract the blind optimization for profit (and efficiency) which capitalism rewards most.</p><p>Environmental regulation is currently insufficient; worldwide. That is the consensus from the Paris Agreement which 195 countries signed in 2015.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement</a></p><p>Maybe incentives?</p><p>We could sell tokens for how much pollutants we're allowed to f### everyone else over with and penalize exceeding the amount we've purchased. That would incentivize firms to pollute less so that they can save money by having to buy fewer tokens.\n(Europe does this already; and it's still not going to save the planet from industrial production externalities)</p><p>So, while I'm wary of any suggestion that a command economy would somehow bring forth talent in governance,\nI look to this article for actionable suggestions that penalize and/or incentivize sustainable business and living practices.</p><p>Sustainable reporting really is a must: how can I design an investment portfolio that excludes reckless, irresponsible, indifferent, and careless investments and highly values sustainability?</p><p>No one likes to be driven by harsh penalties; everyone likes to be rewarded (even with carrots as incentives).</p><p>Markets do not solve for long term outcomes. Case in point: the market has not chosen the most energy efficient cryptocurrencies. Is this an information asymmetry issue: people just don't know, or just don't care because the incentives are so alluring, the brand is so strong, or <i>the perceived security assurances of the network outweighs the energy use</i> (and environmental impact) in comparison to dry cleaning and fossil fuel transport.</p><p>How would a command economy respond to this? It really is denial and delusion to think that the market will cast aside less energy efficient solutions in order to save the environment all on its own.</p><p>So, what do we do?</p><p>Do we incentivize getting inefficient vehicles off of the road and into a recycling plant where they belong?</p><p>Do we shut down major sources of pollution (coal plants, vehicle emissions)?</p><p>Do we create tokens to account for pollution allowances (for carbon and other toxic f###ing chemicals)?</p><p>Do we cut irrational subsidies for industries that don't pay their taxes (even when they make money); so that we're aware of the actual costs of our behavior?</p><p>Do we grow hemp to absorb carbon, clean up the soil, replace emissions, and store energy?</p><p>Who's in the mood to dom these greedy shortsighted idiots into saving themselves and preventing the violation of our right to health (life)? No, you can't because you're busy violating your own rights and finding drugs/druggies and that's not allowed? Is that a lifetime position?</p><p>\"Go burn a charcoal grill and your gas vehicle in your closed garage for awhile and come talk to me.\" That's really what we're dealing with here.</p><p>Anyways, this paper raises some good points; although I have my doubts about command economies.</p><p>[strikethrough] You can't do that to yourself. [/strikethrough] You can't do that to others (even if you pay for their healthcare afterwards).</p><p>Where's Captain Planet when you need 'em, anyways?</p>",

I think it's misunderstood, and that's my fault: I should have included [sarcasm] around the whole comment [/sarcasm].<p>I've written about our need to address climate change here in past comments. I think the administration's climate change denials (see: \"climate change politifact') and regulatory rollbacks are beyond despicable: they're sabotaging the United States by allowing more toxic chemicals into the environment that we all share, and allowing more sites that must be protected with tax dollars that aren't there because these industries pay far less than <i>benchmarks</i> in terms of effective tax rate. We know that vehicle emissions, mercury, and coal ash are toxic: why would we allow people to violate the rights of others in that way?</p><p>A person could voluntarily consume said toxic byproducts and not have violated their own rights or the rights of others, you understand. There's no medical value and low potential for abuse, so we just sit idly by while they're violating the rights of other people by dumping toxic chemicals into the environment that are both poisonous and strongly linked to climate change.</p><p>What would help us care about this? A sarcastic list of additional reasons that we should care? No! Miami underwater during tourist season is enough! I've had enough!</p><p>So, my mistake here - my downvote-earning mistake - was dropping my generally helpful, hopeful tone for cynicism and sarcasm that wasn't motivating enough.</p><p>We need people to regulate pollution in order to prevent further costs of climate change. Water in the streets holds up commerce, travel, hampers national security, and destroys the road.</p><p>We must stop rewarding pollution if we want it - and definitely resultant climate change - to stop.

Many of the reuse applications to date have used the low-grade server exhaust heat in an application physically adjacent to the data center, such as a greenhouse or swimming pool in the building next door. This is reasonable given the relatively low temperatures of data center return air, usually between 28\u00b0 and 35\u00b0C (80-95\u00b0F), and the difficulty in moving heat around. Moving heat energy frequently requires insulated ducting or plumbing instead of cheap, convenient electrical cables. Trenching and installation to run a hot water pipe from a data center to a heat user may cost as much as $600 per linear foot. Just the piping to share heat with a facility one-quarter mile away might add $750,000 or more to a data center construction project. There\u2019s currently not much that can be done to reduce this cost.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>To address the low-temperature issue, some data center operators have started using heat pumps to increase the temperature of waste heat, making the thermal energy much more valuable, and marketable. Waste heat coming out of heat pumps at temperatures in the range of 55\u00b0 to 70\u00b0C (130-160\u00b0F) can be transferred to a liquid medium for easier transport and can be used in district heating, commercial laundry, industrial process heat, and many more.

He defers his taxes until 2026. Instead of paying capital gains tax on $150/share, the cost basis is adjusted by 15% so in addition to benefiting from the time value of money, future Bob will only be taxed on $142.50 of capital gains. Bob can buy a house in an \"opportunity zone\" (from scrolling around the embedded map, there's plenty of million dollar+ houses in these areas. There's also lots of sports teams and stadiums in these areas, so maybe Bob buys an NFL team or a parking lot next to their stadium), rent it out for 10 years, sell it, and not have to pay any capital gains tax on the appreciation. Definitely not a bad deal for him!</p>",

So much for the nature of peer review being entirely driven by the quality of the work.<p>As one of those academics...I keep getting requests to peer review, I respectfully make clear I don't review for non open source journals anymore.

I share the apartment with my mom, and It's a section 8 so our rent contributions are based on the income we make. My contribution towards rent is $400 a month.<p>Although I make more money than my mom (she's of retirement age and only works 1-2 days a week), while I'm looking for more work I want to figure out how to move out and live more independently on only $1200 a month.</p><p>I need to live frugally and want to know what I can cut more easily. I own a used car (already paid in full), and pay my own car insurance, electricity, phone and internet. After all that I have about $400 left each month which can be eaten up by going out or some emergency funds.</p><p>More recently I had to pay for my new city parking sticker so that's $100 more in expenses this particular month. I would be satisfied just living in a far off town paying the same $400 a month, I feel my dollars would stretch further since I now get 100% more privacy for the same price.</p><p>On top of that this job is a contract job so I need to put money aside to pay my own taxes. This $1200 is basically living on poverty level. Any ideas to make saving work? Is it very possible for people in the US to still save while on poverty?</p>",

Buffett is a phenomenal investor but by all accounts, rather odd.

Our findings suggest\nthat Buffett\u2019s success is neither luck nor magic\nbut is a reward for a successful implementation of value and quality exposures that have historically produced high returns. Second, we illustrated how Buffett\u2019s record can be viewed as an expression of the practical implementability of academic factor returns after transaction costs and financing costs. We simulated how investors can try to take advan- tage of similar investment principles. Buffett\u2019s success shows that the high returns of these academic factors are not simply \u201cpaper\u201d returns; these returns can be realized in the real world after transaction costs and funding costs, at least by Warren Buffett. Furthermore, Buffett\u2019s exposure to the BAB factor and his unique access to leverage are consistent with the idea that the BAB factor represents reward to the use of leverage.</i></p>",

The stochastic equation governing our model is transformed into a Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the solution of which features \"quantized\" eigenfunctions. Consequently, stock returns follow a mixed \u03c7 distribution, which describes Gaussian and non-Gaussian features. Analyzing the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) All Share Index, we demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional stochastic process models, e.g., the geometric Brownian motion and the Heston model, with smaller fitting errors and better goodness-of-fit statistics. In addition, making use of analogy, we provide an economic rationale of the physics concepts such as the eigenstate, eigenenergy, and angular frequency, which sheds light on the relationship between finance and econophysics literature.</i></p><p>\"Quantum harmonic oscillator\"\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator</a></p>",

      "text": "Although vulnerability scanners can be a useful tool, I find it very troublesome that you can utter the sentence \"this package contains XX vulnerabilities, and that package contains YY vulnerabilities\" <i>and then stop talking</i>. You've provided barely any useful information!<p>The quantity of vulnerabilities in an image is not really all that useful information. A large amount of vulnerabilities in a Docker image does not necessarily imply that there's anything insecure going on. Many people don't realize that a vulnerability is usually defined as \"has a CVE security advisory\", and that CVEs get assigned based on a worst-case evaluation of the bug. As a result, having a CVE in your container barely tells you anything about your actual vulnerability position. In fact, most of the time you will find that having a CVE in some random utility doesn't matter. Most CVEs in system packages don't apply to most of your containers' threat models.</p><p>Why not? Because an attacker is very unlikely to be able to use vulnerabilities in these system libraries or utilities. Those utilities are usually not in active use in the first place. Even if they are used, you are not usually in a position to exploit these vulnerabilities as an attacker.</p><p>Just as an example, a hypothetical outdated version of grep in one of these containers can hypothetically contain many CVEs. But if your Docker service doesn't use grep, then you would need to <i>manually run</i> grep to be vulnerable. And an attacker that is able to run grep in your Docker container has <i>already owned you</i> - it doesn't make a difference that your grep is vulnerable! This hypothetical vulnerable version of grep therefore makes no difference in the security of your container, despite containing many CVEs.</p><p>It's the <i>quality</i> of these vulnerabilities that matters. Can an attacker actually exploit the vulnerabilities to do bad things? The answer for almost all of these CVEs is \"no\". But that's not really the product that Snyk sells - Snyk sells a product to show you as many vulnerabilities as possible. Any vulnerability scanner company thinks it can provide most business value (and make the most money) by reporting as many vulnerabilities as it can. For sure it can help you to pinpoint those few vulnerabilities that are exploitable, but that's where your own analysis comes in.</p><p>I'm not saying there's not a lot to improve in terms of container security. There's a <i>whole bunch</i> to improve there. But focusing on quantities like \"amount of CVEs in an image\" is not the solution - it's marketing.</p>",

There is no real package management for Docker. Hell, there isn't even an official way to determine if your image needs an upgrade (I wrote a ruby script that gets the latest tags from a docker repo, extracts the ones with numbers and sorts them in order and compares them to what I have running).<p>Relying on an Alpine/Debian/Ubuntu base helps to get dependencies installed quickly. Docker could have just created their own base distro and some mechanism to track package updates across images, but they did not.</p><p>There are guides for making bare containers, they contain nothing .. no ip, grep, bash .. only the bare minimum libraries and requirements to run your service. They are minimal, but incredibly difficult to debug (sysdig still sucks unless you shell out money for enterprise).</p><p>I feel like containers are alright, but Docker is a partial dumpster fire. cgroup isolation is good, the crazy way we deal with packages in container systems is not so good.</p><p>Sure if you're just checking for base-distro packages for security vulnerabilities, you're going to find security issues that don't apply (e.g. an exploit in libpng even though your container runs nothing that even links to libpng), but it does excuse the whole issue with the way containers are constructed.</p><p>I think this space is really open too, for people to find better systems that are also portable: image formats that are easy to build, easy to maintain dependencies for, and easy to run as FreeBSD jails OR Linux cgroup managed containers (Docker for FreeBSD translated images to jails, but it's been unmaintained for years).</p>",

It is not an either-or. Hearing/seeing the information, processing it in a way that makes sense to you individually, and then mechanically writing it down in a legible manner is one of the main methods that your brain learns. It's one of the primary reasons that taking notes is important in the first place. This is referred to as the \"encoding hypothesis\" [1].</p><p>There are actually even studies [2] that show that tools that assist in more efficient note taking, such as taking notes via typing rather than by hand, are actually detrimental to absorbing information, as it makes it easier for you to effectively pass the information directly from your ears to your computer without actually doing the processing that is required when writing notes by hand. This is why many universities prefer (or even require) notes to be taken by hand, and disallow laptops in class.</p><p>1: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0361476X78900206\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0361476X78...</a></p><p>2: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-...</a></p>",

      "text": "&gt; <i>The mechanical task of taking notes is one of the most important parts of actually absorbing the material. It is not an either-or. Hearing/seeing the information, processing it in a way that makes sense to you individually, and then mechanically writing it down in a legible manner is one of the main methods that your brain learns. It's one of the primary reasons that taking notes is important in the first place. This is referred to as the \"encoding hypothesis\" [1].</i><p>There's almost certainly an advantage to learning to think about math using a publishable symbol set like LaTeX.</p><p>We learn by reinforcement; with feedback loops that may take until weeks later in a typical university course.</p><p>&gt; <i>There are actually even studies [2] that show that tools that assist in more efficient note taking, such as taking notes via typing rather than by hand, are actually detrimental to absorbing information, as it makes it easier for you to effectively pass the information directly from your ears to your computer without actually doing the processing that is required when writing notes by hand.</i></p><p>Handwriting notes is impractical for some people due to e.g. injury and illegibility.</p><p>The linked study regarding retention and handwritten versus typed notes has been debunked with references that are referenced elsewhere in comments on this post. There have been a few studies with insufficient controls (lack of randomization, for one) which have been widely repeated by educators who want to be given attention.</p><p>Doodling has been shown to increase information retention. Maybe doodling as a control really would be appropriate.</p><p>Banning laptops from lectures is not respectful of students with injury and illegible handwriting. Asking people to put their phones on silent (so they can still make and take emergency calls) and refrain from distracting other students with irrelevant content on their computers is reasonable and considerate.</p><p>(What a cool approach to math note-taking. I feel a bit inferior because I haven't committed to learning that valuable, helpful skill and so that's stupid and you're just wasting your time because that's not even necessary when all you need to do is retain the information you've paid for for the next few months at most. If course, once you get on the job, you'll never always be using that tool and e.g. latex2sympy to actually apply that theory to solving a problem that people are willing to pay for. So, thanks for the tips and kudos, idiot)</p>",

As an example: I have a checklist for when I need to travel, it contains stuff like what to pack, asking someone to feed my cat, check windows are closed, dishwasher empty, heating turned down, etc. Before the checklist, I would always be worried I forgot something, now I can relax.</p><p>Also, checklists are a great way to improve processes. Basically a way to debug your life. For instance: I once forgot to empty the trash bin before a long trip, I added that to my checklist and haven't had a smelly surprise ever since ;)</p>",

He was about to pass out and he asked me not call an ambulance (God bless America) , he appeared to have a concussion. \nBy this time there was about 10-15 people around him and he could barely talk. I asked him what his phone code was and instead of just giving it to me he said \"it's the first four prime numbers\". \nImmediately, about five people shout \"1,2,3,5\". I am no longer holding the phone, because I handed to someone else to make sure it was okay. \nSure enough, I was in a mathematical proofs class and we had just discussed this topic. So, I say \"one is not a prime number\".\nOf course, we get the phone unlocked in the second try with \"2,3,5,7\" and the guys mom is on the way. Everyone thought I was a genius a hero.",
